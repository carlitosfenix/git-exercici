00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.018
<i>People always ask me
if I know Tyler Durden.</i>

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:09.986
Three minutes.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:12.395
This is it. Ground zero.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:16.163
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:19.797
<i>With a gun barrel between your teeth,
you speak only in vowels.</i>

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:21.965
I can't think of anything.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.910
<i>For a second, I forget about
Tyler's controlled demolition thing</i>

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:28.173
<i>and I wonder how clean that gun is.</i>

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.307
It's getting exciting now.

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:33.580
<i>That old thing,
how you always hurt the one you love.</i>

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:35.780
<i>Well, it works both ways.</i>

00:02:35.856 --> 00:02:40.122
<i>We have front-row seats
for this theater of mass destruction.</i>

00:02:40.227 --> 00:02:42.991
<i>The Demolitions Committee
of Project Mayhem</i>

00:02:43.063 --> 00:02:46.500
<i>wrapped the foundations
of 12 buildings with explosives.</i>

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.669
<i>In two minutes,
primary charges will blow base charges</i>

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:54.106
<i>and a few blocks will be reduced
to smoldering rubble.</i>

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.235
<i>I know this because Tyler knows this.</i>

00:02:57.312 --> 00:03:00.714
Two and a half.
Think of everything we've accomplished.

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:06.151
<i>Suddenly I realize that all of this,
the gun, the bombs, the revolution,</i>

00:03:06.254 --> 00:03:09.520
<i>has got something to do
with a girl named Marla Singer.</i>

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.426
<i>Bob. Bob had bitch tits.</i>

00:03:14.496 --> 00:03:18.695
<i>This was a support group
for men with testicular cancer.</i>

00:03:18.768 --> 00:03:22.067
<i>The big moosie slobbering all over me,
that was Bob.</i>

00:03:22.138 --> 00:03:24.299
We're still men.

00:03:24.373 --> 00:03:26.568
Yes, we're men.

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.870
Men is what we are.

00:03:28.944 --> 00:03:32.381
<i>Bob had had his testicles removed.
Then hormone therapy.</i>

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:36.281
<i>He developed bitch tits because
his testosterone was too high</i>

00:03:36.352 --> 00:03:38.480
<i>and his body upped the estrogen.</i>

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:42.286
<i>- That was where I fit...
- They'll have to drain my pecs again.</i>

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.851
<i>..between those huge sweating tits</i>

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:49.160
<i>that hung enormous,
the way you'd think of God's as big.</i>

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:51.461
OK, you cry now.

00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:54.096
<i>No, wait. Back up. Let me start earlier.</i>

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.103
<i>For six months, I couldn't sleep.</i>

00:03:58.175 --> 00:04:00.736
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

00:04:00.812 --> 00:04:02.973
<i>With insomnia, nothing's real.</i>

00:04:03.081 --> 00:04:05.140
<i>Everything's far away.</i>

00:04:06.084 --> 00:04:08.416
<i>Everything's a copy of a copy</i>

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.544
<i>of a copy.</i>

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.419
<i>When deep space exploration ramps up,
it'll be the corporations that name everything.</i>

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.588
<i>The IBM Stellar Sphere.</i>

00:04:20.932 --> 00:04:22.992
<i>The Microsoft Galaxy.</i>

00:04:23.102 --> 00:04:25.161
<i>The Planet Starbucks.</i>

00:04:25.738 --> 00:04:28.799
I need you out of town this week
to cover some red flags.

00:04:28.907 --> 00:04:32.434
<i>It must have been Tuesday.
He had on his cornflower blue tie.</i>

00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:37.141
You want me to deprioritize my reports
until you advise of a status upgrade?

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:41.812
Prioritize these. Here's your flight coupons.
Call me if there's any snags.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.789
<i>He was full of pep.
Must have had his grande latte enema.</i>

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.025
<i>Like so many others, I had become
a slave to the Ikea nesting instinct.</i>

00:04:52.132 --> 00:04:54.464
Yes. I'd like to order

00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:56.831
the Erika Pekkari dust ruffles.

00:04:56.936 --> 00:04:59.030
<i>- Please hold.
- Anything clever,</i>

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.473
<i>like a coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang,
I had to have it.</i>

00:05:04.544 --> 00:05:06.945
<i>The Klipsk personal office unit.</i>

00:05:07.014 --> 00:05:09.278
<i>The Hovetrekke home exerbike.</i>

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.211
<i>Or the Ohamshab sofa
with the Strinne green stripe pattern.</i>

00:05:13.287 --> 00:05:18.782
<i>Even the Ryslampa wire lamps of
environmentally-friendly unbleached paper.</i>

00:05:18.859 --> 00:05:21.658
<i>I'd flip through catalogs and wonder</i>

00:05:21.797 --> 00:05:24.822
<i>"What kind of dining set
defines me as a person?"</i>

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:29.667
<i>I had it all. Even the glass dishes
with tiny bubbles and imperfections,</i>

00:05:29.805 --> 00:05:34.868
<i>proof that they were crafted by the honest,
hard-working, indigenous peoples of...</i>

00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:37.911
<i>- Please hold.
- ..wherever.</i>

00:05:38.413 --> 00:05:40.506
<i>We used to read pornography.</i>

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:43.449
<i>Now it was the Horchow collection.</i>

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:46.919
- No. You can't die of insomnia.
- What about narcolepsy?

00:05:47.022 --> 00:05:49.389
I nod off, I wake up in strange places.

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:51.518
I have no idea how I got there.

00:05:51.627 --> 00:05:55.427
- You need to lighten up.
- Can you please just give me something?

00:05:55.498 --> 00:05:59.127
<i>Red and blue Tuinals, lipstick-red Seconals...</i>

00:05:59.535 --> 00:06:02.993
No. You need healthy, natural sleep.

00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:07.199
Chew some valerian root
and get more exercise.

00:06:09.245 --> 00:06:11.305
Hey, come on.

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:13.474
- I'm in pain.
- You wanna see pain?

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.110
Swing by First Methodist, Tuesday nights.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.280
See the guys with testicular cancer.

00:06:19.356 --> 00:06:21.449
That's pain.

00:06:37.342 --> 00:06:40.743
I always wanted three kids...
two boys and a girl.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:43.245
Mindy wanted two girls and a boy.

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:47.317
We never could agree on anything.

00:06:47.652 --> 00:06:49.450
Well, I... She...

00:06:49.522 --> 00:06:52.046
She had her first child last week.

00:06:52.123 --> 00:06:54.353
A girl.

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:57.691
With... With her... With her new husband.

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:00.590
Fuck!

00:07:01.934 --> 00:07:03.993
Thank God, you know...

00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:06.162
I'm glad for her.

00:07:06.972 --> 00:07:09.942
She deserves...

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:17.581
Everyone, let's thank Thomas
for sharing himself with us.

00:07:17.684 --> 00:07:19.743
Thank you, Thomas.

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:23.322
I look around this room,
and I see a lot of courage.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.483
And that gives me strength.

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:27.925
We give each other strength.

00:07:27.994 --> 00:07:30.292
It's time for the one-on-ones.

00:07:30.897 --> 00:07:35.301
So let's all of us follow Thomas's example
and really open ourselves up.

00:07:35.368 --> 00:07:37.427
Could you find a partner?

00:07:39.607 --> 00:07:42.770
<i>And this is how I met the big moosie.</i>

00:07:44.445 --> 00:07:47.642
<i>His eyes already shrink-wrapped in tears.</i>

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.949
<i>Knees together. Those awkward little steps.</i>

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.252
- My name is Bob.
- Bob?

00:08:00.962 --> 00:08:03.227
<i>Bob had been a champion bodybuilder.</i>

00:08:03.332 --> 00:08:06.995
<i>You know that chest expansion programme
on late-night TV?</i>

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.162
<i>That was his idea.</i>

00:08:09.237 --> 00:08:11.330
I was a juicer.

00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:13.533
You know, using steroids?

00:08:13.609 --> 00:08:16.135
Diabonal and

00:08:16.212 --> 00:08:18.544
Wisterol.

00:08:18.615 --> 00:08:22.550
Oh, they use that on racehorses,
for Christ sakes.

00:08:23.051 --> 00:08:25.145
And now I'm bankrupt.

00:08:26.022 --> 00:08:28.081
I'm divorced.

00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.952
My two grown kids

00:08:31.794 --> 00:08:34.456
won't even return my phone calls.

00:08:34.564 --> 00:08:39.628
<i>Strangers with this kind of honesty
make me go a big, rubbery one.</i>

00:08:41.437 --> 00:08:43.496
Go ahead,... Cornelius.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:45.666
You can cry.

00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:04.861
<i>And then... something happened.
I let go.</i>

00:09:04.995 --> 00:09:07.054
That's really good.

00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:09.225
<i>Lost in oblivion.</i>

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.598
<i>Dark and silent and complete.</i>

00:09:14.605 --> 00:09:18.303
<i>I found freedom.
Losing all hope was freedom.</i>

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:22.839
It's OK.

00:09:25.116 --> 00:09:27.311
<i>Babies don't sleep this well.</i>

00:09:30.923 --> 00:09:33.517
<i>I became addicted.</i>

00:09:47.239 --> 00:09:49.298
If I didn't say anything

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:52.072
people always assumed the worst.

00:09:55.916 --> 00:09:58.976
They cried harder... then I cried harder.

00:10:08.396 --> 00:10:12.559
Now we're going to open the green door,
the heart chakra...

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:14.726
<i>I wasn't really dying.</i>

00:10:14.869 --> 00:10:17.599
<i>I wasn't host to cancer or parasites.</i>

00:10:18.539 --> 00:10:22.407
<i>I was the warm little center
that the life of this world crowded around.</i>

00:10:23.411 --> 00:10:26.380
Imagine your pain
as a white ball of healing light.

00:10:26.481 --> 00:10:30.578
It moves over your body, healing you.

00:10:30.686 --> 00:10:34.177
Now keep this going. Remember to breathe

00:10:34.288 --> 00:10:37.952
and step forward
through the back door of the room.

00:10:38.794 --> 00:10:40.921
Where does it lead?

00:10:41.029 --> 00:10:43.156
To your cave.

00:10:43.232 --> 00:10:45.132
Step forward

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:47.395
into your cave.

00:10:47.503 --> 00:10:49.562
That's right.

00:10:49.638 --> 00:10:53.130
You're going deeper into your cave.

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:55.902
And you're going to find

00:10:55.978 --> 00:10:58.106
your power animal.

00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:01.547
Slide.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.723
<i>Every evening I died.</i>

00:11:15.865 --> 00:11:18.561
<i>And every evening I was born again.</i>

00:11:19.169 --> 00:11:21.229
<i>Resurrected.</i>

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:27.472
<i>Bob loved me because he thought
my testicles were removed too.</i>

00:11:27.578 --> 00:11:30.376
<i>Being there, pressed against his tits,</i>

00:11:30.447 --> 00:11:32.540
<i>ready to cry.</i>

00:11:32.616 --> 00:11:35.279
<i>This was my vacation.</i>

00:11:37.588 --> 00:11:39.215
<i>And she</i>

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.953
<i>ruined everything.</i>

00:11:42.027 --> 00:11:44.154
This is cancer, right?

00:11:47.032 --> 00:11:49.262
<i>This chick, Marla Singer,</i>

00:11:49.367 --> 00:11:51.995
<i>did not have testicular cancer.</i>

00:11:52.103 --> 00:11:54.196
<i>She was a liar.</i>

00:11:54.272 --> 00:11:56.365
<i>She had no diseases at all.</i>

00:11:56.442 --> 00:12:00.241
<i>I had seen her at Free And Clear,
my blood parasites group, Thursdays.</i>

00:12:00.312 --> 00:12:03.771
<i>Then at Hope,
my bimonthly sickle-cell circle.</i>

00:12:04.283 --> 00:12:09.243
<i>And again, at Seize The Day,
my tuberculosis, Friday night.</i>

00:12:10.388 --> 00:12:12.380
<i>Marla,</i>

00:12:12.458 --> 00:12:14.926
<i>the big tourist.</i>

00:12:15.027 --> 00:12:17.120
<i>Her lie reflected my lie.</i>

00:12:17.663 --> 00:12:19.723
<i>And suddenly, I felt nothing.</i>

00:12:19.833 --> 00:12:23.461
<i>I couldn't cry. So once again,</i>

00:12:23.536 --> 00:12:25.629
<i>I couldn't sleep.</i>

00:12:36.617 --> 00:12:39.085
<i>Next group, after guided meditation,</i>

00:12:39.219 --> 00:12:42.620
<i>after we open our heart chakras,
when it's time to hug,</i>

00:12:42.689 --> 00:12:45.852
<i>I'm gonna grab that bitch,
Marla Singer, and scream.</i>

00:12:45.926 --> 00:12:49.920
Marla, you liar!
You big tourist, I need this! Now, get out!

00:12:52.033 --> 00:12:54.432
<i>I hadn't slept in four days.</i>

00:12:54.501 --> 00:12:56.367
<i>We'll just let that dry...</i>

00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:59.907
<i>When you have insomnia,
you're never really asleep.</i>

00:12:59.974 --> 00:13:02.465
<i>And you're never really awake.</i>

00:13:03.646 --> 00:13:06.136
To begin tonight's communion,

00:13:06.247 --> 00:13:08.943
Chloe would like to say a few words.

00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:11.985
<i>Oh, yeah. Chloe.</i>

00:13:12.888 --> 00:13:17.848
<i>Chloe looked the way Meryl Streep's skeleton
would look if you made it walk around</i>

00:13:17.927 --> 00:13:19.986
<i>being extra nice to everybody.</i>

00:13:20.496 --> 00:13:22.555
Well, I'm still here.

00:13:22.932 --> 00:13:25.060
But I don't know for how long.

00:13:25.902 --> 00:13:28.995
That's as much certainty
as anyone can give me.

00:13:29.104 --> 00:13:31.072
But I've got some good news.

00:13:31.173 --> 00:13:34.905
I no longer have any fear of death.

00:13:38.814 --> 00:13:42.581
But... I am in a pretty lonely place.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:45.713
No-one will have sex with me.

00:13:46.891 --> 00:13:51.293
I'm so close to the end,
and all I want is to get laid for the last time.

00:13:51.895 --> 00:13:55.354
I have pornographic movies
in my apartment,

00:13:55.433 --> 00:13:59.130
- and lubricants and amyl nitrite.
- Thank you, Chloe.

00:13:59.836 --> 00:14:01.964
Everyone, let's thank Chloe.

00:14:02.039 --> 00:14:04.200
Thank you, Chloe.

00:14:07.011 --> 00:14:10.845
Now, let's ready ourselves
for guided meditation.

00:14:11.983 --> 00:14:15.384
You're standing at the entrance of your cave.

00:14:15.853 --> 00:14:19.346
You step inside your cave and you walk...

00:14:19.424 --> 00:14:22.551
<i>If I did have a tumor, I'd name it Marla.</i>

00:14:23.595 --> 00:14:25.586
<i>Marla.</i>

00:14:25.664 --> 00:14:30.124
<i>The scratch on the roof of your mouth
that would heal if you could stop tonguing it.</i>

00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:32.328
<i>But you can't.</i>

00:14:33.238 --> 00:14:36.071
<i>..deeper into your cave as you walk.</i>

00:14:36.174 --> 00:14:39.736
<i>You feel a healing energy all around you.</i>

00:14:42.382 --> 00:14:44.440
<i>Now find your power animal.</i>

00:14:47.353 --> 00:14:49.378
Slide.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.295
OK. Let's partner up.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.694
Pick someone special to you tonight.

00:15:04.905 --> 00:15:06.997
Hey.

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:09.467
- We need to talk.
- Sure.

00:15:14.281 --> 00:15:16.374
- I'm onto you.
- What?

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.578
Yeah. You're a faker. You're not dying.

00:15:19.653 --> 00:15:21.450
Sorry?

00:15:21.522 --> 00:15:26.517
In the Tibetan-philosophy, Sylvia-Plath
sense of the word, I know we're all dying.

00:15:26.628 --> 00:15:30.826
- But you're not dying the way Chloe is.
- So?

00:15:31.433 --> 00:15:33.492
So you're a tourist.

00:15:33.601 --> 00:15:37.800
I've seen you. I saw you at melanoma,
I saw you at tuberculosis.

00:15:37.873 --> 00:15:40.397
I saw you at testicular cancer!

00:15:40.475 --> 00:15:42.102
I saw you practicing this.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.645
- Practicing what?
- Telling me off.

00:15:44.713 --> 00:15:48.547
Is it going as well as you hoped,... Rupert?

00:15:48.651 --> 00:15:50.447
I'll expose you.

00:15:50.518 --> 00:15:52.612
Go ahead. I'll expose you.

00:15:53.355 --> 00:15:56.222
Come together. Let yourselves cry.

00:16:03.232 --> 00:16:05.325
Oh, God. Why are you doing this?

00:16:05.434 --> 00:16:08.165
It's cheaper than a movie
and there's free coffee.

00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:11.034
Look, this is important.
These are my groups.

00:16:11.107 --> 00:16:13.234
I've been coming for over a year.

00:16:13.342 --> 00:16:16.540
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:20.480
When people think you're dying,
they listen to you instead of...

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:23.542
Instead of waiting for their turn to speak.

00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:26.914
Yeah. Yeah.

00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:30.959
Share yourself... completely.

00:16:31.762 --> 00:16:33.854
Look, you don't want to get into this.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:35.990
- It becomes an addiction.
- Really?

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.366
I'm not kidding. I can't cry
if another faker is present, and I need this.

00:16:40.471 --> 00:16:42.530
You gotta find somewhere else to go.

00:16:42.607 --> 00:16:46.168
Candystripe a cancer ward.
It's not my problem.

00:16:49.347 --> 00:16:51.407
No, wait a second. Hold on.

00:16:51.517 --> 00:16:53.576
We'll split up the week, OK?

00:16:53.685 --> 00:16:55.879
You take lymphoma and tuberculosis.

00:16:55.953 --> 00:16:59.082
You take tuberculosis.
My smoking doesn't go over at all.

00:16:59.158 --> 00:17:02.491
OK. Good. Fine.
Testicular cancer should be no contest.

00:17:02.561 --> 00:17:06.497
Technically, I have more right to be there.
You still have your balls.

00:17:06.565 --> 00:17:08.931
- You're kidding.
- I dunno. Am I?

00:17:09.601 --> 00:17:11.034
No. No.

00:17:11.136 --> 00:17:13.765
- What do you want?
- I'll take the parasites.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.638
You can't have both.
Take the blood parasites.

00:17:16.743 --> 00:17:21.043
- I want brain parasites.
- I'll take the blood but I want brain dementia.

00:17:21.147 --> 00:17:23.911
- I want that.
- You can't have the whole brain.

00:17:23.983 --> 00:17:26.508
So far, you have four. I only have two.

00:17:26.586 --> 00:17:30.522
OK. Take both the parasites. They're yours.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:32.854
Now we both have three...

00:17:35.596 --> 00:17:38.224
Hey! You left half your clothes.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.944
- What, are you selling those?
- Yes!

00:17:57.018 --> 00:17:59.077
I'm selling some clothes!

00:17:59.187 --> 00:18:01.245
So! We each have three. That's six.

00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:04.189
What about the seventh day?
I want bowel cancer.

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:06.352
<i>The girl had done her homework.</i>

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.554
No. No. I want bowel cancer.

00:18:09.197 --> 00:18:11.257
That's your favorite too?

00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:14.858
- Tried to slip it by me, eh?
- Look, we'll split it.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:17.029
Take the first and third Sunday.

00:18:19.508 --> 00:18:21.373
Deal.

00:18:23.979 --> 00:18:26.278
Looks like this is goodbye.

00:18:26.382 --> 00:18:28.509
Let's not make a big thing out of it.

00:18:28.618 --> 00:18:31.052
How's this for not making a big thing?

00:18:34.523 --> 00:18:36.320
Hey, Marla!

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:38.820
Marla!

00:18:38.894 --> 00:18:41.489
Maybe we should exchange numbers.

00:18:41.598 --> 00:18:43.498
Should we?

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.660
- We might wanna switch nights.
- OK.

00:18:52.843 --> 00:18:55.335
<i>This is how I met Marla Singer.</i>

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.312
<i>Marla's philosophy of life
was that she might die at any moment.</i>

00:19:01.418 --> 00:19:03.717
<i>The tragedy, she said, was that she didn't.</i>

00:19:03.821 --> 00:19:07.847
It doesn't have your name!
Who are you? Cornelius? Rupert?

00:19:07.924 --> 00:19:11.884
Travis? Any of the stupid names
you give each night?

00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:16.925
<i>You wake up at SeaTac.</i>

00:19:17.035 --> 00:19:19.970
<i>SFO. LAX.</i>

00:19:20.071 --> 00:19:22.437
<i>You wake up at O'Hare.</i>

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.668
<i>Dallas Fort Worth.</i>

00:19:24.743 --> 00:19:26.711
<i>BWI.</i>

00:19:26.779 --> 00:19:30.578
<i>Pacific. Mountain. Central.
Lose an hour. Gain an hour.</i>

00:19:30.682 --> 00:19:34.551
The check-in for that flight
isn't for another two hours, sir.

00:19:34.653 --> 00:19:37.918
<i>This is your life,
and it's ending one minute at a time.</i>

00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:40.982
<i>You wake up at Air Harbor International.</i>

00:19:42.394 --> 00:19:46.262
<i>If you wake up at a different time,
in a different place,</i>

00:19:46.332 --> 00:19:48.995
<i>could you wake up as a different person?</i>

00:19:49.102 --> 00:19:51.160
<i>Everywhere I travel,</i>

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:53.534
<i>tiny life.</i>

00:19:53.605 --> 00:19:56.131
<i>Single-serving sugar and cream.</i>

00:19:56.209 --> 00:19:58.006
<i>Single pat of butter.</i>

00:19:58.111 --> 00:20:00.944
<i>The microwave cordon bleu hobby kit.</i>

00:20:01.014 --> 00:20:02.982
<i>Shampoo-conditioner combos.</i>

00:20:03.083 --> 00:20:06.951
<i>Sample-package mouthwash.
Tiny bars of soap.</i>

00:20:08.388 --> 00:20:10.914
<i>The people I meet on each flight,</i>

00:20:10.991 --> 00:20:13.117
<i>they're single-serving friends.</i>

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:16.925
<i>Between takeoff and landing,
we have our time together.</i>

00:20:16.997 --> 00:20:19.227
<i>That's all we get.</i>

00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:21.233
<i>Welcome!</i>

00:20:23.337 --> 00:20:27.535
<i>On a long enough time line,
the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

00:20:27.608 --> 00:20:31.340
<i>I was a recall coordinator.
My job was to apply the formula.</i>

00:20:31.413 --> 00:20:33.813
The infant went through the windshield.

00:20:33.915 --> 00:20:37.976
<i>A new car built by my company
leaves somewhere traveling at 60mph.</i>

00:20:38.053 --> 00:20:40.146
<i>The rear differential locks up.</i>

00:20:41.189 --> 00:20:43.783
The teenager's braces
are stuck to the ashtray.

00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:46.225
Might make a good anti-smoking ad.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:49.820
<i>The car crashes and burns
with everyone trapped inside.</i>

00:20:49.931 --> 00:20:52.195
<i>Now, should we initiate a recall?</i>

00:20:52.267 --> 00:20:54.361
The father must have been huge.

00:20:54.437 --> 00:20:57.667
See where the fat burned to the seat?
The polyester shirt?

00:20:57.773 --> 00:20:59.764
Very modern art.

00:20:59.841 --> 00:21:02.333
<i>Take the number of vehicles in the field, A.</i>

00:21:02.412 --> 00:21:05.142
<i>Multiply it by the probable rate of failure, B.</i>

00:21:05.214 --> 00:21:09.014
<i>Multiply the result by
the average out-of-court settlement, C.</i>

00:21:09.085 --> 00:21:11.178
<i>A x B x C</i>

00:21:11.387 --> 00:21:13.287
equals X.

00:21:13.389 --> 00:21:15.984
If X is less than the cost of a recall,

00:21:16.059 --> 00:21:18.084
we don't do one.

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:21.391
Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?

00:21:21.464 --> 00:21:23.399
You wouldn't believe.

00:21:24.868 --> 00:21:27.393
Which car company do you work for?

00:21:27.471 --> 00:21:29.598
A major one.

00:21:32.075 --> 00:21:36.011
<i>Every time the plane banked too sharply
on takeoff or landing,</i>

00:21:36.079 --> 00:21:39.379
<i>I prayed for a crash or a midair collision.</i>

00:21:40.051 --> 00:21:41.608
<i>Anything.</i>

00:21:50.462 --> 00:21:54.193
<i>Life insurance pays off triple
if you die on a business trip.</i>

00:21:57.135 --> 00:22:00.435
"If you are seated in an emergency exit row

00:22:00.506 --> 00:22:04.032
and would be unable or unwilling
to perform the duties

00:22:04.108 --> 00:22:08.546
listed on the safety card, please
ask a flight attendant to reseat you."

00:22:10.349 --> 00:22:12.408
It's a lot of responsibility.

00:22:12.485 --> 00:22:14.715
Wanna switch seats?

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.256
No. I'm not sure
I'm the man for that particular job.

00:22:18.324 --> 00:22:22.728
An exit-door procedure at 30,000 ft.

00:22:22.829 --> 00:22:24.887
The illusion of safety.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:27.223
Yeah. I guess so.

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:30.235
You know why
they put oxygen masks on planes?

00:22:30.303 --> 00:22:34.865
- So you can breathe.
- Oxygen gets you high.

00:22:35.976 --> 00:22:39.503
In a catastrophic emergency,
you take giant panic breaths.

00:22:39.579 --> 00:22:42.104
Suddenly you become euphoric, docile.

00:22:42.182 --> 00:22:44.481
You accept your fate.

00:22:45.119 --> 00:22:47.143
It's all right here.

00:22:47.254 --> 00:22:50.383
Emergency water landing, 600 mph.

00:22:50.491 --> 00:22:53.324
Blank faces. Calm as Hindu cows.

00:22:53.394 --> 00:22:55.487
That's...

00:22:56.731 --> 00:22:58.995
That's an interesting theory.

00:23:01.002 --> 00:23:03.129
- What do you do?
- What do you mean?

00:23:03.204 --> 00:23:05.298
What do you do for a living?

00:23:05.374 --> 00:23:08.536
Why? So you can pretend you're interested?

00:23:11.212 --> 00:23:12.703
OK.

00:23:12.781 --> 00:23:15.682
You have
a kind of sick desperation in your laugh.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.980
We have the exact same briefcase.

00:23:21.823 --> 00:23:23.814
Soap.

00:23:23.926 --> 00:23:27.590
- Sorry?
- I make and I sell soap.

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.095
The yardstick of civilization.

00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:32.567
<i>And this is how I met...</i>

00:23:32.701 --> 00:23:34.499
Tyler Durden.

00:23:34.571 --> 00:23:39.838
Did you know if you mix gasoline and
frozen orange juice, you can make napalm?

00:23:39.943 --> 00:23:42.912
- No, I did not. Is that true?
- That's right.

00:23:42.979 --> 00:23:46.813
One can make all kinds of explosives
with simple household items.

00:23:46.916 --> 00:23:49.351
- Really?
- If one was so inclined.

00:23:54.324 --> 00:23:59.388
Tyler, you are by far the most interesting
single-serving friend I have ever met.

00:24:01.265 --> 00:24:05.395
- Everything on a plane is single-serving...
- Oh, I get it. Very clever.

00:24:05.469 --> 00:24:07.027
Thank you.

00:24:07.137 --> 00:24:09.230
How's it working out for you?

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.071
- What?
- Being clever?

00:24:12.177 --> 00:24:14.542
Great.

00:24:14.612 --> 00:24:17.604
Keep it up, then. Right up.

00:24:18.817 --> 00:24:20.978
A question of etiquette.

00:24:21.052 --> 00:24:24.044
As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch?

00:24:31.096 --> 00:24:33.429
<i>How I came to live with Tyler is...</i>

00:24:33.499 --> 00:24:37.798
<i>Airlines have this policy
about vibrating luggage.</i>

00:24:45.478 --> 00:24:50.108
- Was it ticking?
- Throwers know modern bombs don't tick.

00:24:50.216 --> 00:24:53.379
- Sorry, throwers?
- Baggage handlers.

00:24:53.452 --> 00:24:55.683
But when a suitcase vibrates,

00:24:55.822 --> 00:24:58.483
the throwers have got to call the police.

00:24:58.591 --> 00:25:02.083
- My suitcase was vibrating?
- Nine times out of ten

00:25:02.194 --> 00:25:04.254
it's an electric razor.

00:25:04.331 --> 00:25:06.458
But... every once in a while

00:25:09.402 --> 00:25:11.462
it's a dildo.

00:25:12.239 --> 00:25:16.300
It's company policy never to imply
ownership in the event of a dildo.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:20.278
<i>We have to use the indefinite article,
a dildo, never</i>

00:25:20.347 --> 00:25:22.440
<i>your dildo.</i>

00:25:22.516 --> 00:25:24.610
I don't own...

00:25:27.288 --> 00:25:30.416
<i>I had everything in that suitcase.
My CK shirts.</i>

00:25:30.491 --> 00:25:33.654
<i>My DKNY shoes. My AX ties.</i>

00:25:35.329 --> 00:25:37.661
<i>Never mind.</i>

00:25:39.535 --> 00:25:42.264
Hey! That's my car!

00:25:48.577 --> 00:25:50.545
<i>Home was a condo on the 15th floor</i>

00:25:50.646 --> 00:25:53.671
<i>of a filing cabinet
for widows and professionals.</i>

00:25:53.748 --> 00:25:56.377
<i>The walls were solid concrete.</i>

00:25:56.485 --> 00:25:58.544
<i>A foot of concrete is important</i>

00:25:58.654 --> 00:26:02.921
<i>when your next-door neighbor
has to watch game shows at full volume.</i>

00:26:02.992 --> 00:26:06.893
<i>Or when a blast of debris
that used to be your personal effects</i>

00:26:06.962 --> 00:26:10.990
<i>blows out of your windows
and sails flaming into the night.</i>

00:26:17.474 --> 00:26:19.738
<i>I suppose these things happen.</i>

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:34.683
There's... nothing up there.

00:26:34.759 --> 00:26:38.160
You can't go into the unit. Police orders.

00:26:46.838 --> 00:26:49.362
Do you have somebody you can call?

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.567
<i>How embarrassing.</i>

00:26:51.642 --> 00:26:54.544
<i>A houseful of condiments and no food.</i>

00:27:03.989 --> 00:27:07.756
<i>The police later told me
the pilot light might have gone out</i>

00:27:08.761 --> 00:27:11.729
<i>letting out just a little bit of gas.</i>

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:14.061
<i>That gas could have filled the condo.</i>

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:17.659
<i>1700 square feet with high ceilings
for days and days.</i>

00:27:25.878 --> 00:27:29.645
<i>Then the refrigerator's compressor
could have clicked on.</i>

00:27:30.751 --> 00:27:32.809
<i>Yeah?</i>

00:27:35.955 --> 00:27:38.015
<i>I can hear you breathing...</i>

00:27:46.667 --> 00:27:50.603
<i>If you ask me now,
I couldn't tell you why I called him.</i>

00:28:33.849 --> 00:28:36.080
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.413
<i>- Tyler?
- Who is this?</i>

00:28:41.957 --> 00:28:44.153
We met... We met on the airplane.

00:28:44.261 --> 00:28:46.491
We had the same suitcase?

00:28:46.563 --> 00:28:48.655
The clever guy?

00:28:48.731 --> 00:28:51.098
<i>Oh, yeah. Right.</i>

00:28:53.103 --> 00:28:55.731
I called a second ago. There was no answer.

00:28:55.839 --> 00:29:00.037
<i>- I'm at a payphone.
- Yeah, I *69'd you. I never pick up my phone.</i>

00:29:02.779 --> 00:29:04.873
<i>So what's up?</i>

00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:07.574
Well.

00:29:07.685 --> 00:29:09.744
You're not gonna believe this.

00:29:11.888 --> 00:29:14.119
You know, it could be worse.

00:29:14.191 --> 00:29:17.957
A woman could cut off your penis
while you sleep and toss it out of a car.

00:29:18.796 --> 00:29:22.095
There's always that. I don't know.

00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:25.294
When you buy furniture,
you tell yourself, that's it.

00:29:25.369 --> 00:29:27.463
That's the last sofa I'll need.

00:29:27.539 --> 00:29:30.337
Whatever happens,
that sofa problem is handled.

00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:33.866
I had it all.
I had a stereo that was very decent.

00:29:33.978 --> 00:29:37.506
A wardrobe that was getting very respectable.

00:29:37.582 --> 00:29:39.743
I was close to being complete.

00:29:39.818 --> 00:29:42.379
- Shit, man. Now it's all gone.
- All gone.

00:29:42.488 --> 00:29:45.217
All gone.

00:29:46.491 --> 00:29:48.516
Do you know what a duvet is?

00:29:48.593 --> 00:29:51.495
- A comforter.
- It's a blanket.

00:29:51.564 --> 00:29:55.556
Just a blanket. Why do guys
like you and I know what a duvet is?

00:29:55.634 --> 00:29:59.799
Is this essential to our survival
in the hunter-gatherer sense?

00:29:59.906 --> 00:30:01.533
No.

00:30:01.607 --> 00:30:03.598
What are we, then?

00:30:03.711 --> 00:30:06.304
I dunno. Consumers.

00:30:06.379 --> 00:30:08.438
Right. We're consumers.

00:30:08.548 --> 00:30:11.814
We are by-products of a lifestyle obsession.

00:30:11.919 --> 00:30:15.820
Murder, crime, poverty.
These things don't concern me.

00:30:15.922 --> 00:30:19.359
What concerns me are celebrity magazines,

00:30:19.426 --> 00:30:21.519
television with 500 channels,

00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:24.257
some guy's name on my underwear. Rogaine.

00:30:24.365 --> 00:30:26.425
Viagra. Olestra.

00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:29.366
- Martha Stewart.
- Fuck Martha Stewart.

00:30:29.436 --> 00:30:32.928
She's polishing the brass on the Titanic.
It's all going down.

00:30:33.041 --> 00:30:36.772
So fuck off with your sofa units
and Strinne green stripe patterns.

00:30:36.845 --> 00:30:40.177
I say never be complete.

00:30:40.247 --> 00:30:42.273
I say stop being perfect.

00:30:42.384 --> 00:30:44.409
I say let's evolve.

00:30:44.486 --> 00:30:46.784
Let the chips fall where they may.

00:30:48.957 --> 00:30:51.050
But that's me, and I could be wrong.

00:30:51.159 --> 00:30:53.218
Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.

00:30:53.294 --> 00:30:55.786
It's just stuff. Not a tragedy...

00:30:55.865 --> 00:30:59.631
You did lose a lot of versatile solutions
for modern living.

00:30:59.701 --> 00:31:02.295
Fuck, you're right. I don't smoke.

00:31:05.674 --> 00:31:09.440
My insurance is probably gonna cover it, so...

00:31:11.881 --> 00:31:14.008
What?

00:31:14.116 --> 00:31:17.245
The things you own end up owning you.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.648
Do what you like, man.

00:31:23.392 --> 00:31:25.827
Oh, it's late.

00:31:25.896 --> 00:31:28.626
- Hey, thanks for the beer.
- Yeah, man.

00:31:28.698 --> 00:31:30.791
I should find a hotel.

00:31:31.535 --> 00:31:33.628
What?

00:31:33.703 --> 00:31:35.330
What?

00:31:35.439 --> 00:31:37.498
- A hotel?
- Yeah.

00:31:37.607 --> 00:31:40.668
- Just ask, man.
- What are you talking about?

00:31:40.745 --> 00:31:44.510
Oh, God. Three pitchers of beer
and you still can't ask.

00:31:45.515 --> 00:31:47.143
What?

00:31:47.251 --> 00:31:49.879
You called me
because you needed a place to stay.

00:31:49.954 --> 00:31:53.412
- Oh, hey. No, no, no.
- Yes, you did. So just ask.

00:31:53.491 --> 00:31:56.051
Cut the foreplay and just ask, man.

00:31:57.862 --> 00:32:00.126
Would... Would that be a problem?

00:32:00.231 --> 00:32:02.291
Is it a problem for you to ask?

00:32:03.302 --> 00:32:05.531
- Can I stay at your place?
- Yeah.

00:32:06.904 --> 00:32:08.964
Thanks.

00:32:13.145 --> 00:32:16.138
- I want you to do me a favor.
- Yeah, sure.

00:32:16.249 --> 00:32:18.648
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

00:32:18.717 --> 00:32:20.685
What?

00:32:20.752 --> 00:32:24.587
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

00:32:24.691 --> 00:32:27.591
<i>Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Durden.</i>

00:32:27.793 --> 00:32:30.159
<i>Tyler was a night person.</i>

00:32:30.262 --> 00:32:32.493
While the rest of us slept, he worked.

00:32:32.565 --> 00:32:35.728
He had one part-time job as a projectionist.

00:32:35.802 --> 00:32:38.794
A movie doesn't come all on one big reel.
It comes on a few.

00:32:38.905 --> 00:32:42.602
Someone has to switch the projectors
at the exact moment

00:32:42.709 --> 00:32:45.941
that one reel ends and the next one begins.

00:32:46.013 --> 00:32:49.948
You can see little dots come into
the upper right corner of the screen.

00:32:50.016 --> 00:32:52.747
In the industry, we call them cigarette burns.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.913
That's the cue for a changeover.

00:32:54.989 --> 00:32:59.756
He flips the projectors, movie keeps
going and the audience has no idea.

00:32:59.827 --> 00:33:02.091
Why would anyone want this shitjob?

00:33:02.196 --> 00:33:05.359
Because it affords him
interesting opportunities.

00:33:05.432 --> 00:33:08.960
Like splicing a frame of pornography
into family films.

00:33:09.037 --> 00:33:14.030
So when the snooty cat and the courageous
dog with the celebrity voices first meet,

00:33:14.175 --> 00:33:18.374
that's when you'll catch a flash
of Tyler's contribution to the film.

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:27.847
Nobody knows that they saw it but they did.

00:33:27.956 --> 00:33:30.517
Nice, big cock.

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:38.061
Even a hummingbird
couldn't catch Tyler at work.

00:33:43.406 --> 00:33:48.434
Tyler also works sometimes as a banquet
waiter at the luxurious Pressman hotel.

00:33:53.083 --> 00:33:57.143
<i>He was the guerrilla terrorist
of the food service industry.</i>

00:33:57.253 --> 00:33:59.552
Do not watch. I cannot go when you watch.

00:33:59.623 --> 00:34:04.026
Apart from seasoning the lobster bisque,
he farted on meringues,

00:34:04.094 --> 00:34:06.654
and as for the cream of mushroom soup...

00:34:06.763 --> 00:34:08.788
Go ahead, tell 'em.

00:34:08.865 --> 00:34:10.856
You get the idea.

00:34:11.068 --> 00:34:14.300
- You just want me to hit you?
- Come on. Do me this one favor.

00:34:14.405 --> 00:34:17.771
- Why?
- I don't know. Never been in a fight. You?

00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:21.835
- No. But that's a good thing.
- You can't know yourself if you haven't!

00:34:21.913 --> 00:34:24.279
I don't wanna die without any scars.

00:34:24.382 --> 00:34:28.648
- Come on. Hit me, before I lose my nerve.
- Oh, God. This is crazy.

00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.018
So go crazy! Let it rip.

00:34:31.089 --> 00:34:33.785
- I don't know about this.
- I don't either.

00:34:33.858 --> 00:34:36.919
Who gives a shit? No-one's watching.
What do you care?

00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:39.496
This is crazy. You want me to hit you?!

00:34:39.597 --> 00:34:41.656
That's right.

00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:44.931
- Where? Like, in the face?
- Surprise me.

00:34:47.106 --> 00:34:49.199
This is so fucking stupid.

00:35:00.086 --> 00:35:02.280
Motherfucker!

00:35:02.354 --> 00:35:04.447
He hit me in the ear!

00:35:04.523 --> 00:35:07.721
- Well, Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Ow, Christ!

00:35:07.827 --> 00:35:09.886
- Why the ear, man?
- I fucked it up.

00:35:09.963 --> 00:35:11.692
No, that was perfect.

00:35:24.577 --> 00:35:26.704
No, it's all right.

00:35:27.548 --> 00:35:29.641
It really hurts.

00:35:30.084 --> 00:35:32.143
Right.

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.715
Hit me again.

00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:36.916
No, you hit me. Come on!

00:35:53.875 --> 00:35:56.366
We should do this again sometime.

00:36:09.157 --> 00:36:11.388
- Where's your car?
- What car?

00:36:21.904 --> 00:36:24.236
<i>I don't know how Tyler found that house</i>

00:36:24.374 --> 00:36:26.605
<i>but he said he'd been there for a year.</i>

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.576
<i>It looked like it was waiting to be torn down.</i>

00:36:29.645 --> 00:36:32.045
<i>Most of the windows were boarded up.</i>

00:36:32.148 --> 00:36:37.519
<i>There was no lock on the front door from
when the police, or whoever, kicked it in.</i>

00:36:37.588 --> 00:36:39.647
<i>The stairs were ready to collapse.</i>

00:36:39.757 --> 00:36:42.248
<i>I didn't know if he owned it or was squatting.</i>

00:36:42.393 --> 00:36:44.861
<i>Neither would have surprised me.</i>

00:36:45.763 --> 00:36:47.823
Yep. That's you.

00:36:47.932 --> 00:36:50.526
That's me. That's the toilet. Good?

00:36:50.602 --> 00:36:52.660
Yeah, thanks.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.670
<i>What a shithole.</i>

00:36:54.772 --> 00:36:56.741
<i>Nothing worked.</i>

00:37:00.378 --> 00:37:04.280
<i>Turning on one light meant
another light in the house went out.</i>

00:37:04.416 --> 00:37:08.147
<i>There were no neighbors.
Just warehouses and a paper mill.</i>

00:37:08.219 --> 00:37:12.213
<i>That fart smell of steam.
The hamster-cage smell of wood chips.</i>

00:37:13.992 --> 00:37:16.392
What have we here?

00:37:31.177 --> 00:37:33.271
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:37:44.257 --> 00:37:47.317
<i>Every time it rained, we had to kill the power.</i>

00:37:48.228 --> 00:37:51.629
<i>By the end of the first month,
I didn't miss TV.</i>

00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:56.000
<i>I didn't even mind the warm, stale refrigerator.</i>

00:38:08.348 --> 00:38:10.476
Can I be next?

00:38:14.889 --> 00:38:16.949
All right, man.

00:38:17.059 --> 00:38:19.049
Lose the tie.

00:38:23.064 --> 00:38:27.468
<i>At night, Tyler and I were alone
for half a mile in every direction.</i>

00:38:32.908 --> 00:38:36.844
<i>Rain trickled down through
the plaster and the light fixtures.</i>

00:38:36.912 --> 00:38:39.746
<i>Everything wooden swelled and shrank.</i>

00:38:39.849 --> 00:38:43.045
<i>Everywhere were rusted nails
to snag your elbow on.</i>

00:38:43.118 --> 00:38:45.713
<i>The previous occupant had been a shut-in.</i>

00:38:45.788 --> 00:38:47.881
Hey, man. What are you reading?

00:38:47.957 --> 00:38:52.325
Listen to this. It's an article written
by an organ in the first person.

00:38:52.394 --> 00:38:55.159
"I am Jack's medulla oblongata.
Without me,

00:38:55.265 --> 00:38:58.723
Jack could not regulate
his heart rate or breathing."

00:38:58.801 --> 00:39:00.895
There's a whole series of these.

00:39:00.971 --> 00:39:03.063
"I Am Jill's Nipples."

00:39:05.074 --> 00:39:09.068
- "I Am Jack's Colon."
- "I Get Cancer. I Kill Jack."

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:16.116
<i>After fighting, everything else
in life got the volume turned down.</i>

00:39:18.122 --> 00:39:19.817
What?

00:39:19.924 --> 00:39:23.486
<i>- You could deal with anything.
- Have you finished those reports?</i>

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:30.727
<i>If you could choose,
who would you fight?</i>

00:39:30.802 --> 00:39:32.895
I'd fight my boss, probably.

00:39:32.971 --> 00:39:35.098
Really?

00:39:35.173 --> 00:39:38.540
- Yeah, why? Who would you fight?
- I'd fight my dad.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.703
I don't know my dad.

00:39:40.779 --> 00:39:42.713
I mean, I know him, but...

00:39:42.781 --> 00:39:45.148
He left when I was like, six years old.

00:39:45.217 --> 00:39:48.208
Married this other woman
and had some other kids.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.379
He did this every six years.

00:39:50.522 --> 00:39:54.619
- He changes city and starts a new family.
- Fucker's setting up franchises!

00:39:55.428 --> 00:39:57.554
My dad never went to college.

00:39:57.629 --> 00:40:01.566
- So it was real important that I go.
- That sounds familiar.

00:40:01.634 --> 00:40:06.072
So I graduate. Call him up long-distance
and say, "Dad, now what?"

00:40:06.173 --> 00:40:08.164
- He says, "Get a job."
- Same here.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:10.936
Now I'm 25. Make my yearly call again.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.001
"Dad, now what?"

00:40:13.079 --> 00:40:15.207
He says, "I dunno. Get married."

00:40:15.282 --> 00:40:18.774
You can't get married.

00:40:19.552 --> 00:40:21.612
I'm a 30-year-old boy.

00:40:21.688 --> 00:40:24.179
We're a generation of men raised by women.

00:40:24.257 --> 00:40:28.558
I'm wondering if another woman
is really the answer we need.

00:40:34.568 --> 00:40:37.766
<i>Most of the week, we were Ozzie and Harriet.</i>

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.075
<i>But every Saturday night,
we were finding something out.</i>

00:40:43.277 --> 00:40:46.769
<i>We were finding out more and more
that we were not alone.</i>

00:40:50.686 --> 00:40:55.315
<i>It used to be that when I came home angry
or depressed, I'd just clean my condo.</i>

00:40:55.423 --> 00:40:57.483
<i>Polish my Scandinavian furniture.</i>

00:40:57.626 --> 00:41:02.654
<i>I should have been looking for a new condo
or haggling with my insurance company.</i>

00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:06.497
<i>I should have been upset
about my nice flaming little shit.</i>

00:41:06.635 --> 00:41:08.500
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

00:41:08.637 --> 00:41:12.267
The premise of cybernetting an office
is make things more efficient.

00:41:12.342 --> 00:41:15.208
<i>Monday mornings,
I just thought about next week.</i>

00:41:15.277 --> 00:41:18.303
Can I get the icon in cornflower blue?

00:41:18.414 --> 00:41:19.507
Absolutely.

00:41:19.649 --> 00:41:22.880
Efficiency is priority No.1, people.

00:41:23.019 --> 00:41:25.816
Because waste is a thief.

00:41:25.888 --> 00:41:29.017
I showed this to my man here.
You liked it, didn't you?

00:41:32.696 --> 00:41:36.632
<i>You can swallow a pint of blood
before you get sick.</i>

00:41:37.667 --> 00:41:39.897
<i>It was right in everyone's face.</i>

00:41:39.969 --> 00:41:42.131
<i>Tyler and I just made it visible.</i>

00:41:42.239 --> 00:41:44.673
<i>It was on the tip of everyone's tongue.</i>

00:41:44.742 --> 00:41:46.835
<i>Tyler and I just gave it a name.</i>

00:41:58.055 --> 00:42:00.114
Come on, you've gotta go home!

00:42:22.347 --> 00:42:24.679
Turn off the jukebox. Lock the back.

00:42:45.571 --> 00:42:49.303
<i>Every week,
Tyler gave the rules that he and I decided.</i>

00:42:49.376 --> 00:42:51.435
Gentlemen!

00:42:52.212 --> 00:42:54.304
Welcome to Fight Club.

00:42:56.416 --> 00:42:58.577
The first rule of Fight Club is

00:42:58.719 --> 00:43:01.051
you do not talk about Fight Club.

00:43:01.155 --> 00:43:03.750
The second rule of Fight Club is

00:43:04.158 --> 00:43:07.594
you do not talk about Fight Club!

00:43:07.728 --> 00:43:09.993
Third rule of Fight Club.

00:43:10.064 --> 00:43:12.862
Someone yells stop, goes limp, taps out,

00:43:12.967 --> 00:43:15.730
the fight is over. Fourth rule.

00:43:15.803 --> 00:43:18.136
Only two guys to a fight.

00:43:18.206 --> 00:43:20.071
Fifth rule.

00:43:20.175 --> 00:43:22.837
One fight at a time, fellas.

00:43:22.944 --> 00:43:25.413
Sixth rule. No shirts. No shoes.

00:43:25.481 --> 00:43:29.416
Seventh rule.
Fights will go on as long as they have to.

00:43:31.252 --> 00:43:33.847
And the eighth and final rule.

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:38.186
If this is your first night at Fight Club

00:43:38.259 --> 00:43:40.353
you have to fight.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.460
<i>This kid from work, Ricky,</i>

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:51.063
<i>couldn't remember whether
you ordered pens with blue ink or black.</i>

00:43:51.173 --> 00:43:53.573
<i>But Ricky was a god for ten minutes</i>

00:43:53.642 --> 00:43:57.010
<i>when he trounced
the maitre d' of a local food court.</i>

00:43:58.881 --> 00:44:04.218
<i>Sometimes, all you could hear were the flat,
hard, packing sounds over the yelling.</i>

00:44:07.991 --> 00:44:11.017
<i>Or the wet choke
when someone gasped and sprayed...</i>

00:44:11.094 --> 00:44:13.119
Stop!

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.098
<i>You weren't alive anywhere
like you were there.</i>

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:21.000
<i>But Fight Club only exists in the hours
between when Fight Club starts and ends.</i>

00:44:21.504 --> 00:44:24.531
<i>Even if I could tell someone
they had a good fight,</i>

00:44:24.642 --> 00:44:26.940
<i>I wouldn't be talking to the same man.</i>

00:44:27.044 --> 00:44:30.343
<i>Who you were in Fight Club
is not who you were outside of it.</i>

00:44:30.448 --> 00:44:35.476
<i>A guy came to Fight Club for the first time.
His ass was a wad of cookie dough.</i>

00:44:35.553 --> 00:44:38.421
<i>After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.</i>

00:44:39.258 --> 00:44:42.455
If you could fight any celebrity,
who would you fight?

00:44:42.526 --> 00:44:45.655
- Alive or dead?
- Doesn't matter. Who'd be tough?

00:44:46.565 --> 00:44:49.693
Hemingway. You?

00:44:50.335 --> 00:44:53.498
Shatner. I'd fight William Shatner.

00:44:54.539 --> 00:44:57.770
<i>We all started seeing things differently.</i>

00:44:59.044 --> 00:45:02.378
<i>Everywhere we went,
we were sizing things up.</i>

00:45:05.717 --> 00:45:08.881
<i>I felt sorry for guys packed into gyms,</i>

00:45:08.955 --> 00:45:13.051
<i>trying to look like how Calvin Klein
or Tommy Hilfiger said they should.</i>

00:45:13.126 --> 00:45:15.254
Is that what a man looks like?

00:45:16.162 --> 00:45:18.995
Oh, self-improvement is masturbation.

00:45:19.098 --> 00:45:21.157
Now, self-destruction...

00:45:21.267 --> 00:45:23.259
Excuse me.

00:45:57.906 --> 00:46:01.103
<i>Fight Club wasn't about winning or losing.</i>

00:46:01.176 --> 00:46:03.235
<i>It wasn't about words.</i>

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:08.639
<i>The hysterical shouting was in tongues</i>

00:46:08.751 --> 00:46:10.718
<i>like at a Pentecostal Church.</i>

00:46:15.257 --> 00:46:17.350
- Is that it?
- Stop!

00:46:17.426 --> 00:46:20.327
<i>When the fight was over, nothing was solved.</i>

00:46:20.396 --> 00:46:22.330
<i>But nothing mattered.</i>

00:46:22.398 --> 00:46:25.196
Cool.

00:46:25.267 --> 00:46:28.066
<i>Afterwards, we all felt saved.</i>

00:46:29.006 --> 00:46:31.270
Hey, man. How about next week?

00:46:31.375 --> 00:46:33.433
How about next month?!

00:46:33.542 --> 00:46:35.602
Irvine, you're in the middle.

00:46:35.679 --> 00:46:37.738
New guy, you too.

00:46:39.483 --> 00:46:41.644
<i>Sometimes, Tyler spoke for me.</i>

00:46:41.752 --> 00:46:43.845
He fell down some stairs.

00:46:44.488 --> 00:46:46.581
I fell down some stairs.

00:46:48.425 --> 00:46:53.090
<i>Fight Club became the reason to cut
your hair short or trim your fingernails.</i>

00:46:53.197 --> 00:46:55.664
OK. Any historical figure.

00:46:55.766 --> 00:46:57.632
I'd fight Gandhi.

00:46:58.269 --> 00:47:00.100
Good answer.

00:47:00.204 --> 00:47:02.434
- How about you?
- Lincoln.

00:47:02.507 --> 00:47:05.102
Lincoln?

00:47:05.209 --> 00:47:08.804
Big guy, big reach.
Skinny guys fight till they're burger.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.773
Fuck!

00:47:12.985 --> 00:47:15.647
Hey, even the Mona Lisa's falling apart.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:26.129
Hello?

00:47:26.231 --> 00:47:28.631
<i>Where have you been the last eight weeks?</i>

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.031
<i>Marla?</i>

00:47:33.005 --> 00:47:36.134
<i>- How did you find me?
- You left a forwarding number.</i>

00:47:36.242 --> 00:47:39.233
I haven't seen you at any support groups.

00:47:39.311 --> 00:47:42.509
<i>We split 'em up.
That was the idea. Remember?</i>

00:47:42.615 --> 00:47:45.448
Yeah, but you haven't been going to yours.

00:47:45.518 --> 00:47:49.045
- How do you know?
- I cheated.

00:47:49.122 --> 00:47:50.953
I found a new one.

00:47:51.491 --> 00:47:53.755
- Really?
- It's for men only.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.452
Like the testicle thing?

00:47:59.233 --> 00:48:01.257
Look, this is a bad time.

00:48:01.334 --> 00:48:03.769
I've been going to Debtors Anonymous.

00:48:03.871 --> 00:48:07.432
<i>- They're really fucked-up people...
- I'm on my way out.</i>

00:48:07.508 --> 00:48:09.874
Me too. I've got a stomach full of Xanax.

00:48:09.977 --> 00:48:12.275
I took what was left of a bottle.

00:48:12.346 --> 00:48:14.439
It might have been too much.

00:48:14.515 --> 00:48:18.144
<i>Picture Marla Singer throw herself
around her crummy apartment.</i>

00:48:18.286 --> 00:48:22.745
This isn't a for-real suicide thing.
This is probably a cry-for-help thing.

00:48:22.857 --> 00:48:25.759
So you're staying in tonight, then?

00:48:25.861 --> 00:48:28.694
Do you wanna wait
and hear me describe death?

00:48:28.763 --> 00:48:33.291
<i>Do you wanna listen
and see if my spirit can use a phone?</i>

00:48:35.537 --> 00:48:38.199
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

00:49:04.501 --> 00:49:09.335
<i>Tyler's door was closed. I'd been here for
two months and his door was never closed.</i>

00:49:14.344 --> 00:49:17.404
You won't believe this dream
I had last night.

00:49:17.514 --> 00:49:20.779
I can hardly believe anything about last night.

00:49:30.594 --> 00:49:32.563
What are you doing here?

00:49:35.266 --> 00:49:37.359
What?

00:49:37.435 --> 00:49:39.869
This is my house.
What are you doing here?

00:49:42.273 --> 00:49:44.264
Fuck you!

00:49:58.891 --> 00:50:02.258
Oh, you've got some fucked-up friends!

00:50:02.361 --> 00:50:04.352
Limber, though.

00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:06.421
Silly cooze.

00:50:07.499 --> 00:50:10.230
I come in last night. Phone's off the hook.

00:50:10.303 --> 00:50:12.395
Guess who's on the other end?

00:50:12.471 --> 00:50:14.666
<i>I knew the story before he told me.</i>

00:50:16.977 --> 00:50:20.572
<i>Have you ever heard a death rattle before?</i>

00:50:20.647 --> 00:50:23.480
Do you think it'll live up to its name?

00:50:23.583 --> 00:50:27.178
<i>Or will it just be a death hairball?</i>

00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:34.583
<i>Prepare to evacuate soul.</i>

00:50:34.661 --> 00:50:36.288
<i>Ten,</i>

00:50:36.396 --> 00:50:39.195
<i>nine,... eight...</i>

00:50:39.267 --> 00:50:41.497
<i>How could Tyler, of all people,</i>

00:50:41.602 --> 00:50:45.470
<i>think it was a bad thing
that Marla Singer was about to die?</i>

00:50:45.539 --> 00:50:47.200
<i>Five,</i>

00:50:47.275 --> 00:50:48.867
<i>four...</i>

00:50:49.644 --> 00:50:51.703
Hang on.

00:50:57.151 --> 00:50:59.483
You got here fast.

00:51:01.023 --> 00:51:03.116
Did I call you?

00:51:13.835 --> 00:51:16.930
The mattress is all sealed in slippery plastic.

00:51:20.175 --> 00:51:22.576
Oh, don't worry. It's not a threat to you.

00:51:25.381 --> 00:51:27.281
Oh, fuck!

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:29.443
Somebody called the cops.

00:51:41.364 --> 00:51:44.857
- Hey, where's 513?
- End of the hall.

00:51:45.669 --> 00:51:49.537
The girl who lives there
used to be a charming, lovely girl.

00:51:49.606 --> 00:51:51.767
She has lost faith in herself.

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:54.708
- Miss Singer, let us help you!
- She's a monster!

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:58.909
- You have every reason to live.
- She's infectious human waste!

00:51:58.983 --> 00:52:02.782
- Miss Singer!
- Good luck trying to save her!

00:52:07.592 --> 00:52:09.787
If I fall asleep,

00:52:09.894 --> 00:52:12.158
I'm done for.

00:52:14.132 --> 00:52:16.327
You're gonna have to keep me up

00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:18.494
all night.

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:20.903
Un-fucking-believable.

00:52:20.973 --> 00:52:23.168
<i>He was obviously able to handle it.</i>

00:52:23.242 --> 00:52:26.938
- You know what I mean, you fucked her.
- No, I didn't.

00:52:27.011 --> 00:52:29.139
- Never?
- No.

00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:32.176
You're not into her, are you?

00:52:32.251 --> 00:52:34.343
No! God, not at all.

00:52:34.419 --> 00:52:37.014
<i>I am Jack's raging bile duct.</i>

00:52:37.156 --> 00:52:39.056
Are you sure? You can tell me.

00:52:39.191 --> 00:52:41.022
Believe me, I'm sure.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.426
<i>- Put a gun to my head and spray my brains.
- That's good.</i>

00:52:44.531 --> 00:52:47.260
She's a predator posing as a house pet.
Stay away.

00:52:49.235 --> 00:52:52.865
The shit that came out of
this woman's mouth, I had never heard!

00:52:52.973 --> 00:52:54.634
My God.

00:52:54.741 --> 00:52:58.074
I haven't been fucked like that
since grade school.

00:52:58.211 --> 00:53:00.645
<i>How could Tyler not go for that?</i>

00:53:00.747 --> 00:53:04.274
<i>The other night,
he was splicing sex organs into Cinderella.</i>

00:53:04.384 --> 00:53:07.183
Marla doesn't need a lover,
just a caseworker.

00:53:07.254 --> 00:53:09.848
Or a wash.
This isn't love, it's sport fucking.

00:53:09.956 --> 00:53:12.824
<i>She invaded my support groups
and now my home.</i>

00:53:12.894 --> 00:53:14.987
Hey, hey. Sit down.

00:53:19.065 --> 00:53:22.502
Now, listen.
I can't have you talking to her about me.

00:53:22.603 --> 00:53:24.434
Why would I...

00:53:24.505 --> 00:53:29.875
Say anything about me or what goes on
in this house to her or anybody,... we're done.

00:53:29.977 --> 00:53:32.639
- Now promise me. You promise?
- OK.

00:53:32.713 --> 00:53:34.841
- Yeah, I promise.
- Promise?

00:53:34.917 --> 00:53:38.318
- I just said, I promise! What...
- That's three times you promised.

00:53:39.822 --> 00:53:43.815
<i>If only I had wasted a few minutes
and gone to watch Marla Singer die,</i>

00:53:43.892 --> 00:53:45.985
<i>none of this would have happened.</i>

00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:53.834
Harder, yes! Oh, harder, harder!

00:54:00.443 --> 00:54:02.910
<i>I could have moved to another room.</i>

00:54:04.047 --> 00:54:07.881
<i>On the third floor
where I might not have heard them.</i>

00:54:07.951 --> 00:54:10.044
<i>But I didn't.</i>

00:54:34.279 --> 00:54:38.374
- What are you doing?
- Just going to bed.

00:54:38.482 --> 00:54:40.542
Wanna finish her off?

00:54:43.455 --> 00:54:46.981
- No. No, thank you.
- I've found a cigarette.

00:54:47.091 --> 00:54:50.459
- Who were you talking to?
- Shut up.

00:54:50.529 --> 00:54:53.794
<i>I became the calm little center of the world.</i>

00:54:54.466 --> 00:54:56.526
<i>I was the Zen master.</i>

00:55:01.673 --> 00:55:03.665
<i>I wrote little haiku poems.</i>

00:55:04.310 --> 00:55:06.608
<i>I e-mailed them to everyone.</i>

00:55:06.712 --> 00:55:08.804
Is that your blood?

00:55:10.516 --> 00:55:12.575
Some of it, yeah.

00:55:12.685 --> 00:55:15.347
You can't smoke in here.

00:55:15.421 --> 00:55:17.515
Take the rest of the day off.

00:55:17.591 --> 00:55:20.115
Come back Monday with some clean clothes.

00:55:20.192 --> 00:55:22.319
Get yourself together.

00:55:22.695 --> 00:55:25.028
<i>I got right in everyone's hostile face.</i>

00:55:25.132 --> 00:55:27.623
<i>"Yes, these are bruises from fighting."</i>

00:55:27.734 --> 00:55:29.793
<i>"Yes, I'm comfortable with that."</i>

00:55:29.902 --> 00:55:31.768
<i>"I am enlightened."</i>

00:55:33.707 --> 00:55:38.838
<i>You give up the condo life, give up
all your flaming worldly possessions,</i>

00:55:38.946 --> 00:55:42.006
<i>move to a dilapidated house
in a toxic waste area,</i>

00:55:42.115 --> 00:55:45.983
<i>and you have to come home to this.</i>

00:55:56.631 --> 00:56:00.032
<i>- Hello.
- This is Detective Stern with the Arson Unit.</i>

00:56:00.134 --> 00:56:04.366
<i>We have some new information about
the incident at your former condo.</i>

00:56:04.439 --> 00:56:05.736
Yes.

00:56:05.807 --> 00:56:10.745
I don't know if you're aware, but someone
sprayed Freon into your front-door lock.

00:56:10.813 --> 00:56:13.475
<i>They used a chisel to shatter the cylinder.</i>

00:56:13.582 --> 00:56:15.572
No, I wasn't aware of that.

00:56:15.650 --> 00:56:17.642
<i>I am Jack's cold sweat.</i>

00:56:17.753 --> 00:56:20.017
Does this sound strange to you?

00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:22.956
<i>Yes, sir, strange. Very strange.</i>

00:56:23.025 --> 00:56:25.050
<i>- The dynamite
- Dynamite?</i>

00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:28.254
left a residue
of ammonium oxalate potassium perchloride.

00:56:28.397 --> 00:56:31.834
<i>- Do you know what this means?
- No, what does it mean?</i>

00:56:31.901 --> 00:56:33.835
It means it was home-made.

00:56:33.903 --> 00:56:38.169
I'm sorry. This is just coming
as quite a shock to me, sir.

00:56:38.241 --> 00:56:43.804
Whoever set this dynamite could have blown
out your pilot light days before the explosion.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.974
<i>- The gas was just a detonator.
- Who would go and do that?</i>

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.109
<i>- I'll ask the questions.
- Tell him.</i>

00:56:49.252 --> 00:56:53.656
Tell him the liberator who destroyed
my property realigned my perceptions.

00:56:53.724 --> 00:56:55.817
<i>Excuse me. Are you there?</i>

00:56:55.893 --> 00:56:58.827
I am listening.
It's hard to know what to make of this.

00:56:58.895 --> 00:57:03.390
Have you recently made enemies who might
have access to home-made dynamite?

00:57:03.467 --> 00:57:05.731
- Enemies?
- Reject civilization,

00:57:05.836 --> 00:57:07.896
especially material possessions.

00:57:08.006 --> 00:57:10.872
<i>- Son, this is serious.
- Yes, I know it's serious.</i>

00:57:10.941 --> 00:57:13.535
<i>- I mean that.
- Yes, it's very serious.</i>

00:57:13.644 --> 00:57:16.478
Look, nobody takes this
more seriously than me.

00:57:16.548 --> 00:57:19.278
That condo was my life. OK?

00:57:19.418 --> 00:57:22.910
I loved every stick of furniture in that place.

00:57:23.021 --> 00:57:26.047
<i>That was not just a bunch of stuff
that got destroyed.</i>

00:57:26.124 --> 00:57:29.025
<i>- It was me!
- I'd like to thank the Academy.</i>

00:57:29.094 --> 00:57:33.121
<i>- Is this not a good time for you?
- Just tell him you fucking did it!</i>

00:57:33.231 --> 00:57:37.100
Tell him you blew it all up!
That's what he wants to hear.

00:57:37.170 --> 00:57:42.072
<i>- Are you still there?
- Wait. Are you saying that I'm a suspect?</i>

00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:46.134
No. I may need to talk to you, so you
let me know if you're gonna leave town.

00:57:46.245 --> 00:57:48.645
<i>- OK?
- OK.</i>

00:57:51.318 --> 00:57:55.947
<i>Except for their humping,
Tyler and Marla were never in the same room.</i>

00:57:56.055 --> 00:57:59.116
<i>My parents pulled this exact same act
for years.</i>

00:57:59.193 --> 00:58:02.959
The condom is the glass slipper
of our generation.

00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:05.964
You slip one on when you meet a stranger.

00:58:06.066 --> 00:58:08.125
You... dance all night.

00:58:08.202 --> 00:58:10.295
Then you throw it away.

00:58:10.537 --> 00:58:13.165
The condom, I mean. Not the stranger.

00:58:14.708 --> 00:58:16.175
What?

00:58:21.015 --> 00:58:23.813
I got this dress at a thrift store for $1.

00:58:23.918 --> 00:58:25.782
It was worth every penny.

00:58:25.886 --> 00:58:27.946
It's a bridesmaid's dress.

00:58:28.923 --> 00:58:32.120
Someone loved it intensely

00:58:32.193 --> 00:58:34.218
for one day.

00:58:34.329 --> 00:58:36.422
Then tossed it.

00:58:38.299 --> 00:58:40.358
Like a Christmas tree.

00:58:40.502 --> 00:58:42.595
So special.

00:58:42.705 --> 00:58:44.138
Then

00:58:44.206 --> 00:58:46.003
bam!

00:58:46.108 --> 00:58:48.166
It's on the side of the road.

00:58:48.743 --> 00:58:50.837
Tinsel still clinging to it.

00:58:52.915 --> 00:58:54.974
Like a sex crime victim.

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:57.143
Underwear inside out.

00:58:57.821 --> 00:59:01.654
- Bound with electrical tape.
- Well then, it suits you.

00:59:01.757 --> 00:59:04.453
You can borrow it sometime.

00:59:11.467 --> 00:59:13.561
Get rid of her.

00:59:14.337 --> 00:59:17.238
<i>- What? You get rid of her!
- Don't mention me.</i>

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:21.538
<i>I am six years old again,
passing messages between parents.</i>

00:59:23.547 --> 00:59:27.143
- I really think it's time you left.
- Don't worry, I'm leaving.

00:59:27.218 --> 00:59:31.847
- Not that we don't love your visits.
- You are such a nutcase. I can't keep up.

00:59:34.024 --> 00:59:36.892
Gotta get off

00:59:36.994 --> 00:59:38.256
Thanks. Bye.

00:59:38.362 --> 00:59:44.301
Gotta get off of this merry-go-round

00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:48.904
Gonna get, need to get...

00:59:49.007 --> 00:59:51.032
Gotta get...

00:59:53.244 --> 00:59:54.677
You kids!

00:59:56.682 --> 00:59:59.173
Why do you still waste time with her?

00:59:59.251 --> 01:00:01.583
I'll say this about Marla.

01:00:01.653 --> 01:00:03.918
<i>At least she's trying to hit bottom.</i>

01:00:04.023 --> 01:00:05.319
And I'm not?

01:00:05.424 --> 01:00:08.257
Feathers up your butt
do not make you a chicken.

01:00:08.327 --> 01:00:10.420
What are we doing tonight?

01:00:11.097 --> 01:00:13.327
Tonight... we make soap.

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.425
Really?

01:00:15.534 --> 01:00:18.368
To make soap, first we render fat.

01:00:37.257 --> 01:00:39.487
The salt balance has to be just right

01:00:39.626 --> 01:00:42.118
so the best fat for soap comes from humans.

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:46.024
- Wait, what is this place?
- A liposuction clinic.

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:56.134
Pay dirt!

01:00:56.244 --> 01:01:00.077
Richest, creamiest fat in the world.
Fat of the land!

01:01:05.687 --> 01:01:09.248
No! Don't pull it, don't pull it!

01:01:13.862 --> 01:01:16.126
- Oh, God!
- Give me another one.

01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:25.729
As the fat renders,
the tallows float to the surface.

01:01:25.808 --> 01:01:27.901
Like in Boy Scouts.

01:01:27.977 --> 01:01:31.778
- It's hard to imagine you as a Boy Scout.
- Keep stirring.

01:01:34.116 --> 01:01:37.677
Once the tallow hardens,
you skim off a layer of glycerin.

01:01:37.753 --> 01:01:40.154
Add nitric acid, you've got nitroglycerin.

01:01:40.223 --> 01:01:44.090
Then add sodium nitrate and sawdust,
you've got dynamite.

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.995
Yeah, with enough soap,
one could blow up just about anything.

01:01:48.098 --> 01:01:50.157
<i>Tyler was full of useful information.</i>

01:01:50.233 --> 01:01:54.192
People found clothes got cleaner
when washed at a certain point in the river.

01:01:54.304 --> 01:01:56.329
- You know why?
- No.

01:01:59.176 --> 01:02:02.977
Human sacrifices were once made
on the hills above this river.

01:02:03.047 --> 01:02:06.243
Bodies burnt.
Water permeated the ashes to create lye.

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:08.785
This is lye. The crucial ingredient.

01:02:08.853 --> 01:02:13.654
Once it mixed with the melted body fat,
a white soapy discharge crept into the river.

01:02:13.758 --> 01:02:15.817
May I see your hand, please?

01:02:21.199 --> 01:02:24.431
What is this?

01:02:24.536 --> 01:02:27.129
This is a chemical burn.

01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:30.733
It will hurt more than any burn
and it will leave a scar.

01:02:30.809 --> 01:02:33.437
<i>Meditation worked for cancer,
it could work now.</i>

01:02:34.246 --> 01:02:37.010
- Don't shut the pain out.
- Oh, God!

01:02:37.816 --> 01:02:42.253
The first soap was made from heroes' ashes,
like the first monkey shot into space.

01:02:42.354 --> 01:02:45.347
Without pain or sacrifice,
we would have nothing.

01:02:45.425 --> 01:02:48.360
<i>I tried not to think
of the word searing of flesh.</i>

01:02:48.428 --> 01:02:51.590
Stop it!
This is your pain, this is your burning hand.

01:02:51.697 --> 01:02:54.360
I'm going to my cave
to find my power animal.

01:02:54.434 --> 01:02:58.461
No! Don't deal with this
the way those dead people do! Come on!

01:02:58.571 --> 01:03:02.564
- I get the point!
- No! You're feeling premature enlightenment.

01:03:05.378 --> 01:03:09.440
It's the greatest moment of your life,
and you're off somewhere else!

01:03:09.517 --> 01:03:11.040
I am not!

01:03:11.117 --> 01:03:14.109
Shut up!
Our fathers were our models for God.

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.384
If our fathers bailed,
what does that tell you about God?

01:03:18.392 --> 01:03:23.625
Listen to me. You have to consider
the possibility that God does not like you.

01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:27.827
He never wanted you.
In all probability, He hates you.

01:03:27.902 --> 01:03:31.464
This is not the worst thing that can happen.
We don't need Him!

01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:34.508
- I agree!
- Fuck damnation, fuck redemption.

01:03:34.608 --> 01:03:37.100
We are God's unwanted children? So be it!

01:03:37.212 --> 01:03:41.706
- I'm getting water!
- You can use water and make it worse or...

01:03:42.851 --> 01:03:46.343
- Or use vinegar to neutralize the burn.
- Please let me up!

01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:48.514
First, you have to give up.

01:03:48.623 --> 01:03:51.320
First, you have to know, not fear,

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:54.419
know that some day, you're gonna die.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:56.726
You don't know how this feels!

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:04.970
It's only after we've lost everything
that we're free to do anything.

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:09.069
OK.

01:04:22.326 --> 01:04:24.351
Congratulations.

01:04:24.461 --> 01:04:27.362
You're one step closer to hitting the bottom.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.460
<i>Tyler sold his soap
to department stores at $20 a bar.</i>

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.529
<i>God knows what they charged.</i>

01:04:35.607 --> 01:04:38.871
- This is the best soap.
- Why, thank you, Susan.

01:04:38.942 --> 01:04:41.001
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

01:04:41.111 --> 01:04:44.980
<i>We were selling rich women
their own fat asses back to them.</i>

01:04:45.984 --> 01:04:48.077
<i>He was wearing his yellow tie.</i>

01:04:48.153 --> 01:04:50.417
<i>I didn't wear a tie to work any more.</i>

01:04:50.522 --> 01:04:54.151
"The first rule of Fight Club
is don't talk about Fight Club."

01:04:54.225 --> 01:04:57.787
<i>I'm half-asleep again.
I must have left it in the copy machine.</i>

01:04:57.897 --> 01:05:00.364
"The second rule..." Is this yours?

01:05:02.233 --> 01:05:05.795
Pretend you're me.
Make a managerial decision.

01:05:05.905 --> 01:05:08.339
You find this. What would you do?

01:05:12.978 --> 01:05:14.969
Well, I gotta tell you,

01:05:15.047 --> 01:05:18.710
I'd be very, very careful
who you talk to about that.

01:05:18.817 --> 01:05:22.117
Because the person who wrote that
is dangerous.

01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:26.649
And this button-down, Oxford-cloth psycho
might just snap

01:05:26.793 --> 01:05:29.626
and then stalk from office to office

01:05:29.729 --> 01:05:34.792
with an Armalite AR10 carbine gas-powered
semiautomatic weapon,

01:05:34.868 --> 01:05:39.328
pumping round after round
into colleagues and co-workers.

01:05:40.006 --> 01:05:43.374
This might be someone
you've known for years.

01:05:43.444 --> 01:05:46.571
Someone very, very close to you.

01:05:46.646 --> 01:05:50.048
<i>Tyler's words coming out of my mouth.</i>

01:05:51.052 --> 01:05:53.145
<i>And I used to be such a nice guy.</i>

01:05:53.221 --> 01:05:56.554
Or maybe you shouldn't bring me
every piece of trash you pick up.

01:06:00.394 --> 01:06:04.058
- Compliance and Liability.
- My tit's gonna rot off.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.559
Will you excuse me? I need to take this.

01:06:13.842 --> 01:06:17.470
- What do you mean?
- I need you to check for a lump in my breast.

01:06:17.578 --> 01:06:21.515
- Go to a hospital.
- I can't afford to waste money on a doctor.

01:06:22.484 --> 01:06:24.679
I don't know about this, Marla.

01:06:24.786 --> 01:06:26.482
Please.

01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:30.581
<i>She didn't call Tyler. I'm neutral in her book.</i>

01:06:32.628 --> 01:06:36.656
That's nice.
Taking food to Mrs. Haniver and Mrs. Raines.

01:06:36.733 --> 01:06:38.860
Where are they, exactly?

01:06:38.935 --> 01:06:43.065
Tragically, they're dead.
I'm alive and I'm in poverty. Want any?

01:06:43.139 --> 01:06:45.232
- No, no.
- I got one for you.

01:06:45.308 --> 01:06:47.401
Thanks for the thought.

01:06:48.746 --> 01:06:51.077
What happened to your hand?

01:06:51.147 --> 01:06:53.308
Oh, nothing.

01:06:53.416 --> 01:06:55.476
Right there?

01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:59.216
- Feel anything?
- No.

01:06:59.323 --> 01:07:01.313
Well, make sure.

01:07:01.424 --> 01:07:03.450
OK, I'm pretty sure.

01:07:03.527 --> 01:07:05.518
You feel nothing?

01:07:05.629 --> 01:07:07.927
No, nothing.

01:07:09.466 --> 01:07:12.299
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:17.102
- No problem.
- I wish I could return the favor.

01:07:17.175 --> 01:07:19.268
Breast cancer doesn't run in my family.

01:07:19.344 --> 01:07:22.836
- I could check your prostate.
- I think I'm OK.

01:07:22.947 --> 01:07:25.040
Well, thanks, anyway.

01:07:30.055 --> 01:07:32.354
- Are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

01:07:32.458 --> 01:07:34.652
See you... around.

01:07:51.869 --> 01:07:53.997
Cornelius?

01:07:54.072 --> 01:07:56.437
Cornelius!

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.236
It's me! Bob!

01:07:59.343 --> 01:08:00.776
Hey, Bob.

01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:07.340
- We all thought you were dead.
- No, no. Still here.

01:08:07.418 --> 01:08:11.446
- How are you, Bob?
- Better than I've ever been in my whole life.

01:08:11.556 --> 01:08:15.048
- Really? Still remaining men together?
- No, no.

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:18.891
- I got something so much better now.
- Really, what is it?

01:08:19.564 --> 01:08:21.429
Well...

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.767
The first rule is,
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:27.999
And the second rule is

01:08:28.074 --> 01:08:30.372
I'm not supposed to talk about it.

01:08:30.443 --> 01:08:33.879
- And the third rule is...
- Bob, Bob. I'm a member.

01:08:34.013 --> 01:08:36.072
Look at my face, Bob.

01:08:38.485 --> 01:08:40.816
That's fucking... fucking great.

01:08:40.887 --> 01:08:44.618
- I've never seen you there.
- I go Tuesdays and Thursdays.

01:08:44.691 --> 01:08:48.423
- I go Saturday.
- Congratulations.

01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:51.194
Yeah, hey, to both of us, right?

01:08:51.264 --> 01:08:53.893
Have you heard about the guy
that invented it?

01:08:54.034 --> 01:08:56.901
- Yeah, actually...
- I hear all kinds of things.

01:08:57.037 --> 01:09:00.633
Supposedly,
he was born in a mental institution

01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:04.109
and he sleeps only one hour a night.

01:09:04.211 --> 01:09:06.406
He's a great man.

01:09:07.882 --> 01:09:10.214
Do you know about Tyler Durden?

01:09:35.176 --> 01:09:37.270
I didn't hurt you, did I?

01:09:37.346 --> 01:09:39.439
Actually, you did.

01:09:39.515 --> 01:09:41.574
Thank you for this.

01:09:41.851 --> 01:09:44.252
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:09:44.321 --> 01:09:46.379
<i>Fight Club.</i>

01:09:46.489 --> 01:09:48.582
<i>This was mine and Tyler's gift.</i>

01:09:48.791 --> 01:09:50.759
<i>Our gift to the world.</i>

01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:54.194
I look around, I look around,
I see a lot of new faces.

01:09:55.799 --> 01:09:57.993
Shut up!

01:09:58.134 --> 01:10:02.970
Which means a lot of people have been
breaking the first two rules of Fight Club.

01:10:11.314 --> 01:10:15.376
I see in Fight Club the strongest
and smartest men who've ever lived.

01:10:15.486 --> 01:10:17.545
I see all this potential.

01:10:17.622 --> 01:10:19.714
And I see it squandered.

01:10:20.725 --> 01:10:23.819
Goddamn it,
an entire generation pumping gas.

01:10:24.395 --> 01:10:26.488
Waiting tables.

01:10:26.564 --> 01:10:28.624
Slaves with white collars.

01:10:31.135 --> 01:10:34.195
Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes.

01:10:34.305 --> 01:10:37.571
Working jobs we hate
so we can buy shit we don't need.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.914
We're the middle children of history.

01:10:43.982 --> 01:10:46.041
No purpose or place.

01:10:46.251 --> 01:10:48.344
We have no Great War.

01:10:48.654 --> 01:10:50.748
No Great Depression.

01:10:52.524 --> 01:10:54.856
Our great war is a spiritual war.

01:10:55.327 --> 01:10:58.661
Our great depression is our lives.

01:11:01.534 --> 01:11:04.594
We've all been raised
on television to believe

01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:08.368
that one day we'd be millionaires
and movie gods and rock stars.

01:11:08.441 --> 01:11:10.534
But we won't.

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.045
We're slowly learning that fact.

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:15.613
And we're very, very pissed off.

01:11:15.682 --> 01:11:17.343
Yeah!

01:11:20.254 --> 01:11:24.690
- First rule of Fight Club is, do not talk...

01:11:30.197 --> 01:11:31.459
Who are you?

01:11:32.299 --> 01:11:34.894
- Who am I?
- Yeah.

01:11:35.803 --> 01:11:38.636
There's a sign on the front
that says Lou's Tavern.

01:11:39.707 --> 01:11:43.610
I'm fucking Lou. Who the fuck are you?

01:11:43.678 --> 01:11:45.771
Tyler Durden.

01:11:48.884 --> 01:11:52.376
Who told you motherfuckers
that you could use my place?

01:11:52.454 --> 01:11:54.820
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.484
Irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.

01:11:57.592 --> 01:11:59.719
He don't own this place. I do.

01:12:01.897 --> 01:12:05.390
- How much money's he getting for this?
- There is no money.

01:12:05.468 --> 01:12:08.265
- Free to all.
- Ain't that something?

01:12:08.336 --> 01:12:10.201
It is, actually.

01:12:10.272 --> 01:12:12.707
Look, stupid fuck!

01:12:12.808 --> 01:12:15.333
- I want everybody out of here right now.
- Hey!

01:12:15.444 --> 01:12:17.674
You should join our club.

01:12:18.048 --> 01:12:20.038
Did you hear what I just said?

01:12:20.116 --> 01:12:22.243
You and your friend.

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.248
You hear me now?

01:12:28.458 --> 01:12:30.516
No, I didn't quite catch that, Lou.

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:38.658
Still not getting it.

01:12:39.703 --> 01:12:41.864
OK, OK, I got it.

01:12:41.939 --> 01:12:44.430
I got it, I got it. Shit, I lost it.

01:12:45.475 --> 01:12:47.340
Back! All of you!

01:12:49.047 --> 01:12:51.106
Everybody back!

01:12:58.589 --> 01:13:00.750
Ah, Lou!

01:13:00.858 --> 01:13:04.521
Come on, man!
We really like this place.

01:13:13.572 --> 01:13:16.506
- That's right, Lou. Get it out.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:13:16.607 --> 01:13:18.405
Oh, yeah!

01:13:23.382 --> 01:13:25.475
Is that fucking funny?

01:13:35.028 --> 01:13:37.621
Fucking guy is a loony, I'm telling you.

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.159
Unbelievable.

01:13:44.404 --> 01:13:47.373
- You don't know where I've been, Lou.
- Oh, my God!

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.341
You don't know where I've been!

01:13:53.413 --> 01:13:56.508
Please let us keep it, Lou! Please, Lou!

01:13:56.584 --> 01:13:59.017
Fucking use the basement! Christ!

01:13:59.119 --> 01:14:01.987
I want your word, Lou! I want your word!

01:14:02.056 --> 01:14:04.047
On my mother's eyes.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.327
Thanks, Lou.

01:14:16.638 --> 01:14:18.731
You too, big guy.

01:14:22.676 --> 01:14:24.770
We'll see you next week.

01:14:40.263 --> 01:14:43.857
This week, each one of you
has a homework assignment.

01:14:43.965 --> 01:14:48.801
You're gonna go out. You're gonna
start a fight with a total stranger.

01:14:52.041 --> 01:14:54.202
You're gonna start a fight

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:56.403
and you're gonna lose.

01:14:58.381 --> 01:15:00.316
Excellent choice, sir.

01:15:02.886 --> 01:15:06.184
Hey! Watch out, jackass! Come on!

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:09.218
<i>Now, this is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

01:15:11.929 --> 01:15:13.897
Son of a bitch!

01:15:13.997 --> 01:15:18.730
<i>Most people, normal people,
do just about anything to avoid a fight.</i>

01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:21.730
Excuse me!

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.537
You sprayed me with your hose.
That's not necessary...

01:15:25.643 --> 01:15:27.542
Jay! Go call 911!

01:15:30.281 --> 01:15:32.340
Put the hose down.

01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:34.509
Stop it! Stop it!

01:15:36.154 --> 01:15:38.054
Sorry.

01:15:53.572 --> 01:15:56.040
We need to talk.

01:15:58.277 --> 01:16:00.370
OK.

01:16:00.479 --> 01:16:02.538
Where to begin?

01:16:02.648 --> 01:16:04.843
With your constant absenteeism?

01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:07.478
With your unpresentable appearance?

01:16:07.554 --> 01:16:09.579
You're up for review.

01:16:09.688 --> 01:16:12.885
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.

01:16:12.958 --> 01:16:14.893
- What?
- Let's pretend.

01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:17.862
You're the Department of Transportation,
OK?

01:16:17.931 --> 01:16:21.594
Someone informs you that this company

01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:25.762
installs front-seat mounting brackets
that failed collision tests,

01:16:25.872 --> 01:16:29.274
brake linings that fail after 1,000 miles,

01:16:29.343 --> 01:16:33.779
and fuel injectors
that explode and burn people alive.

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:35.746
What then?

01:16:35.816 --> 01:16:38.114
Are you threatening me?

01:16:38.186 --> 01:16:40.984
- No...
- Get the fuck out of here. You're fired!

01:16:41.088 --> 01:16:45.525
I have a better solution. Keep me
on the payroll as an outside consultant.

01:16:45.593 --> 01:16:47.686
In exchange for my salary,

01:16:47.762 --> 01:16:51.597
my job will be never to tell people
these things that I know.

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:55.965
I don't even have to come into the office.
I can do this job from home.

01:16:57.239 --> 01:17:01.369
Who... Who the fuck do you think you are,
you crazy little shit?

01:17:06.648 --> 01:17:10.175
<i>- Security!
- I am Jack's smirking revenge.</i>

01:17:19.161 --> 01:17:21.255
What the hell are you doing?

01:17:30.473 --> 01:17:32.566
That hurt.

01:17:34.011 --> 01:17:36.070
Why would you do that?

01:17:36.747 --> 01:17:39.738
Oh, my God! No! Please stop!

01:17:49.093 --> 01:17:51.186
What are you doing?

01:17:52.263 --> 01:17:54.356
Oh, God, no! Please! No!

01:17:54.431 --> 01:17:58.562
<i>For some reason,
I thought of my first fight, with Tyler.</i>

01:17:58.637 --> 01:18:00.228
No!

01:18:24.663 --> 01:18:29.124
<i>Under and behind and inside
everything this man took for granted,</i>

01:18:29.235 --> 01:18:32.693
<i>something horrible had been growing.</i>

01:18:32.805 --> 01:18:33.863
Look.

01:18:33.939 --> 01:18:38.672
Give me the paychecks, like I asked,
and you won't ever see me again.

01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:41.543
<i>Then, at our most excellent
moment together...</i>

01:18:44.617 --> 01:18:47.347
Thank God!
Please don't hit me again.

01:18:47.454 --> 01:18:49.547
<i>Telephone, computer,</i>

01:18:49.656 --> 01:18:54.821
<i>fax machine, 52 weekly paychecks
and 48 airline flight coupons.</i>

01:18:54.895 --> 01:18:57.295
<i>We now had corporate sponsorship.</i>

01:18:57.364 --> 01:19:02.530
<i>This is how Tyler and I were able to have
Fight Club every night of the week.</i>

01:19:05.172 --> 01:19:08.767
<i>Now, the center of Fight Club
became the two men fighting.</i>

01:19:08.875 --> 01:19:12.334
<i>The leader walked through the crowd,
out in the darkness.</i>

01:19:14.115 --> 01:19:18.643
<i>Tyler was now involved in
a lawsuit with the Pressman Hotel</i>

01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.984
<i>over the urine content of their soup.</i>

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:29.152
<i>I am Jack's wasted life.</i>

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:38.964
Thank you, sir.

01:19:40.476 --> 01:19:43.468
<i>Tyler dreamed up
new homework assignments.</i>

01:19:43.579 --> 01:19:46.104
<i>He handed them out in sealed envelopes.</i>

01:20:25.256 --> 01:20:28.953
- There's a Fight Club up in Delaware City.
- Yeah, I heard.

01:20:30.762 --> 01:20:32.956
There's one in Penns Grove too.

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:35.260
Bob even found one up in New Castle.

01:20:35.366 --> 01:20:38.427
- Did you start that one?
- No, I thought you did.

01:20:38.537 --> 01:20:41.028
No.

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:32.085
- Stop for a second.
- Hey, what are we doing?

01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:34.217
- Turn around.
- What are we doing?

01:21:34.294 --> 01:21:36.729
- Homework assignment.
- What kind?

01:21:36.831 --> 01:21:38.855
Human sacrifice.

01:21:38.932 --> 01:21:42.265
- Is that a gun? Please tell me it's not.
- It's a gun.

01:21:42.336 --> 01:21:44.703
- What are you doing?
- Meet me in the back.

01:21:44.806 --> 01:21:47.138
- Don't fuck around!
- Meet me in the back.

01:21:47.242 --> 01:21:49.039
<i>On a long enough time line,</i>

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:52.011
<i>the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.</i>

01:21:53.014 --> 01:21:55.073
What are you doing? Come on!

01:21:55.149 --> 01:21:58.551
Hands behind your back.
Give me your wallet.

01:22:00.322 --> 01:22:03.620
Raymond K Hessel.
1320 SE Banning, Apartment A.

01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:07.623
- Small, cramped basement apartment?
- How did you know?

01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:10.324
They give shitty apartments letters.

01:22:10.432 --> 01:22:13.526
Raymond! You're going to die.

01:22:13.636 --> 01:22:15.103
No!

01:22:15.170 --> 01:22:19.334
Is that your mom and dad?
They're gonna have to call the kindly doctor.

01:22:19.441 --> 01:22:21.706
Pick up your dental records. Know why?

01:22:21.778 --> 01:22:25.338
- There'll be nothing left of your face.
- Oh, come on!

01:22:25.447 --> 01:22:29.350
An expired community college student ID.
What did you study, Raymond?

01:22:29.452 --> 01:22:32.478
- S... S... Stuff.
- Stuff?

01:22:32.556 --> 01:22:34.648
Were the midterms hard?

01:22:35.792 --> 01:22:38.352
- I asked you what you studied!
- Biology, mostly.

01:22:38.461 --> 01:22:41.953
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:22:42.065 --> 01:22:45.057
What did you wanna be, Raymond K Hessel?!

01:22:46.469 --> 01:22:50.406
The question, Raymond,
was what did you want to be?

01:22:52.109 --> 01:22:54.168
Answer him, Raymond, Jesus!

01:22:54.278 --> 01:22:56.677
- Veterinarian. Veterinarian.
- Animals.

01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:59.750
- Yeah. Animals and stuff.
- Stuff. Yeah, I got that.

01:22:59.817 --> 01:23:02.377
- So you need more schooling.
- Too much school.

01:23:02.486 --> 01:23:04.955
- Would you rather be dead?
- No, please...

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:09.482
You'd rather die here, on your knees,
in the back of a convenience store?

01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:11.187
Please, no.

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:17.359
I'm keeping your license.

01:23:18.603 --> 01:23:21.596
Gonna check in on you.
I know where you live.

01:23:21.707 --> 01:23:24.699
If you're not working
to be a veterinarian in six weeks,

01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:26.904
you will be dead.

01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:30.839
Now run on home.

01:23:35.588 --> 01:23:37.647
Run, Forrest, run!

01:23:39.325 --> 01:23:41.384
I feel ill.

01:23:42.195 --> 01:23:44.254
Imagine how he feels.

01:23:44.364 --> 01:23:46.423
Come on, this isn't funny!

01:23:46.532 --> 01:23:48.967
What the fuck was the point of that?!

01:23:49.036 --> 01:23:53.165
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Raymond K Hessel's life.

01:23:53.239 --> 01:23:57.609
His breakfast will taste better
than any meal you and I have ever tasted.

01:23:59.046 --> 01:24:01.139
<i>You had to give it to him.</i>

01:24:01.215 --> 01:24:03.581
<i>- Come on.
- He had a plan.</i>

01:24:03.651 --> 01:24:07.087
<i>And it started to make sense
in a Tyler-sort of way.</i>

01:24:07.187 --> 01:24:09.087
<i>No fear. No distractions.</i>

01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:12.488
<i>The ability to let that which does not matter</i>

01:24:12.593 --> 01:24:14.584
<i>truly slide.</i>

01:24:28.009 --> 01:24:30.102
<i>You are not your job.</i>

01:24:32.047 --> 01:24:35.414
You're not how much money
you have in the bank.

01:24:37.118 --> 01:24:39.211
You're not the car you drive.

01:24:39.721 --> 01:24:42.589
You're not the contents of your wallet.

01:24:42.658 --> 01:24:44.990
You're not your fucking khakis.

01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:51.493
You are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.

01:25:00.342 --> 01:25:02.538
I'll be out of your way in a sec.

01:25:03.346 --> 01:25:05.439
You don't have to go.

01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:09.042
Whatever.

01:25:10.153 --> 01:25:13.247
No, I mean... It's OK.

01:25:22.766 --> 01:25:24.894
Are you still going to groups?

01:25:25.570 --> 01:25:27.663
Yeah.

01:25:29.139 --> 01:25:31.232
Chloe's dead.

01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:33.700
Wow, Chloe.

01:25:33.778 --> 01:25:35.712
When did that happen?

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:38.145
Do you care?

01:25:38.249 --> 01:25:41.582
I dunno. I haven't thought about it in a while.

01:25:41.886 --> 01:25:43.945
Yeah, well...

01:25:44.055 --> 01:25:46.388
It was the smart move on her part.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.785
Listen...

01:25:51.095 --> 01:25:53.462
What are you getting out of all this?

01:25:54.166 --> 01:25:56.259
What?

01:25:56.368 --> 01:25:58.700
I mean, all this. Why do you keep...

01:25:59.471 --> 01:26:01.531
Is this making you happy?

01:26:03.142 --> 01:26:05.201
Yeah, well, sometimes.

01:26:06.945 --> 01:26:09.073
I don't know. I don't understand.

01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:12.710
Why does a weaker person
need to latch on to a strong person?

01:26:12.786 --> 01:26:14.912
What is... What is that?

01:26:14.987 --> 01:26:17.149
What do you get out of it?

01:26:18.625 --> 01:26:20.718
No... That's not the same thing at all.

01:26:20.794 --> 01:26:22.922
It's totally different with us.

01:26:22.997 --> 01:26:25.089
Us?

01:26:25.165 --> 01:26:27.099
What do you mean by us?

01:26:27.167 --> 01:26:31.036
- I'm sorry. Do you hear this?
- Hear what?

01:26:31.138 --> 01:26:33.163
- All that noise. Hold on.
- No, wait!

01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:35.969
Don't change the subject!
I want to talk about this.

01:26:36.042 --> 01:26:38.807
- You're not talking about me, are you?
- No.

01:26:38.946 --> 01:26:42.382
- What?
- Playing doctor. What was going on there?

01:26:42.449 --> 01:26:45.715
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Nothing.

01:26:45.787 --> 01:26:47.845
- I don't think so.
- What do you want?

01:26:47.988 --> 01:26:50.388
- Look at me.
- No. What?

01:26:51.158 --> 01:26:53.992
- What is that?!
- It's nothing. Don't worry.

01:26:54.062 --> 01:26:56.462
My God. Who did this?

01:26:56.565 --> 01:26:58.623
- A person.
- Guy or girl?

01:26:58.732 --> 01:27:01.531
- What do you care?
- What do you care if I ask?

01:27:01.603 --> 01:27:04.197
- Leave me alone.
- You're afraid to say.

01:27:04.272 --> 01:27:06.263
- I am not. Let me go.
- No! Talk to me.

01:27:06.374 --> 01:27:07.535
Let go of me!

01:27:07.610 --> 01:27:10.339
- This conversation
- This conversation

01:27:10.412 --> 01:27:12.880
- is over.
- is over.

01:27:13.748 --> 01:27:16.843
I just can't win with you, can I?

01:27:26.195 --> 01:27:28.663
Hey, this is getting a little old!

01:27:29.266 --> 01:27:31.597
What is... What is all this?

01:27:31.667 --> 01:27:33.760
What do you think?

01:27:34.704 --> 01:27:36.832
Hey, why do we need bunk beds?

01:27:36.907 --> 01:27:38.772
Hey!

01:27:45.616 --> 01:27:47.447
Too young.

01:27:47.517 --> 01:27:49.178
Sorry.

01:27:49.253 --> 01:27:51.313
What's all that?

01:27:51.422 --> 01:27:54.390
If the applicant is young,
tell him he's too young.

01:27:54.458 --> 01:27:57.086
- Old, too old. Fat, too fat.
- Applicant?

01:27:57.194 --> 01:28:00.528
If the applicant waits three days
without food or shelter,

01:28:00.632 --> 01:28:02.691
he may enter and begin training.

01:28:02.799 --> 01:28:04.630
Training for what?

01:28:10.241 --> 01:28:12.300
You think this is a game?

01:28:12.410 --> 01:28:15.072
You're too young to train here, end of story.

01:28:15.146 --> 01:28:17.876
Quit wasting our time.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.879
Bad news, friend.

01:28:24.156 --> 01:28:26.248
It's not gonna happen.

01:28:26.324 --> 01:28:28.623
Sorry if there was a misunderstanding.

01:28:28.694 --> 01:28:30.628
It's not the end of the world.

01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.891
Just... go away.

01:28:33.766 --> 01:28:35.825
Go.

01:28:35.901 --> 01:28:39.564
You're trespassing
and I will have to call the police.

01:28:42.676 --> 01:28:44.735
Don't you look at me!

01:28:44.844 --> 01:28:48.108
You're never getting in this fucking house!

01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.548
Never. Now get the fuck off my porch!
Get off my porch!

01:28:51.651 --> 01:28:55.178
<i>Sooner or later,
we all became what Tyler wanted us to be.</i>

01:28:55.288 --> 01:28:58.121
I'm gonna go inside
and I'm gonna get a shovel.

01:29:05.666 --> 01:29:07.861
- Got two black shirts?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:07.935 --> 01:29:10.198
- Two pair of black pants?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:13.273
- One pair black boots? Black socks?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:13.341 --> 01:29:15.400
- One blackjacket.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:15.509 --> 01:29:18.501
- $300 personal burial money?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:20.681 --> 01:29:22.740
All right.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.620
You're too old, fat man.

01:29:34.730 --> 01:29:37.893
Your tits are too big.
Get the fuck off my porch.

01:29:45.707 --> 01:29:47.766
Bob! Bob!

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:06.422
Like a monkey ready to be shot into space.

01:30:07.196 --> 01:30:08.663
Space monkey.

01:30:08.765 --> 01:30:12.258
Ready to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

01:30:18.876 --> 01:30:21.572
You are too fucking old, fatty!

01:30:21.645 --> 01:30:24.842
And you... You're too fucking

01:30:24.948 --> 01:30:26.575
blond!

01:30:26.650 --> 01:30:28.982
Get out of here, the both of you!

01:30:29.053 --> 01:30:31.180
<i>And so it went.</i>

01:30:31.355 --> 01:30:33.449
Listen up, maggots.

01:30:33.558 --> 01:30:35.617
You are not special.

01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.258
You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake.

01:30:39.363 --> 01:30:43.698
You are the same decaying organic matter
as everything else.

01:30:43.802 --> 01:30:45.895
<i>Tyler built himself an army.</i>

01:30:46.171 --> 01:30:49.800
<i>We are the all-singing,
all-dancing crap of the world.</i>

01:30:49.874 --> 01:30:53.503
<i>We are all part of the same compost heap.</i>

01:30:54.579 --> 01:30:57.811
<i>Why was Tyler Durden building an army?</i>

01:30:57.883 --> 01:30:59.975
<i>To what purpose?</i>

01:31:00.051 --> 01:31:02.486
<i>For what greater good?</i>

01:31:05.825 --> 01:31:07.884
<i>In Tyler we trusted.</i>

01:31:13.232 --> 01:31:15.894
When he was like,
"You are not your job",

01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:18.061
I was like, "Yeah!"

01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:22.032
Hey, what's all this?

01:31:22.141 --> 01:31:24.235
Hey!

01:31:25.712 --> 01:31:27.407
OK!

01:31:27.481 --> 01:31:29.847
- What's going on?
- We're celebrating.

01:31:29.916 --> 01:31:32.441
- What are we celebrating?
- Go on.

01:31:36.456 --> 01:31:38.617
- Hey.
- Let me get that for you.

01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:46.098
<i>The same great taste, Pepsi.</i>

01:31:48.469 --> 01:31:50.699
Ssh!

01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:54.571
<i>Investigators are here.
The Police Commissioner has arrived.</i>

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:57.644
<i>Could you tell us
what you think has happened here?</i>

01:31:57.712 --> 01:32:01.945
<i>We believe this is one of many
recent acts of vandalism in the city</i>

01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:05.177
<i>somehow related
to underground boxing clubs.</i>

01:32:05.286 --> 01:32:09.485
<i>We will be coordinating
a rigorous investigation.</i>

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:14.761
<i>That was Police Commissioner Jacobs
who just arrived on the scene</i>

01:32:14.863 --> 01:32:19.095
<i>- of a four-alarm fire that broke out...
- She's hot.</i>

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:20.998
<i>Back to you in the studio.</i>

01:32:21.103 --> 01:32:23.504
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:32:24.474 --> 01:32:26.964
- Holy shit!
- Yeah!

01:32:34.317 --> 01:32:36.342
What the fuck did you guys do?

01:32:36.419 --> 01:32:40.515
<i>Arson investigators
are on the premises...</i>

01:32:44.294 --> 01:32:48.822
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions, sir.

01:32:55.039 --> 01:32:57.564
The victory in the war against crime

01:32:57.641 --> 01:32:59.734
will not come overnight.

01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:04.372
It will take dedication and commitment
and, most of all, cooperation.

01:33:04.448 --> 01:33:09.386
Streets are safer now.
There is hope in the inner city. However...

01:33:09.454 --> 01:33:11.444
I gotta take a piss.

01:33:11.555 --> 01:33:14.320
These are the first steps in a long journey.

01:33:14.392 --> 01:33:16.986
That is why we have created Project Hope.

01:33:17.062 --> 01:33:19.155
Bob.

01:33:22.267 --> 01:33:25.031
Project Hope will be a joint effort

01:33:25.136 --> 01:33:27.866
between the police and community leaders.

01:33:27.973 --> 01:33:32.137
It will be a powerful new weapon
in the war against crime.

01:34:17.591 --> 01:34:21.722
- Wrap it around the top of his Hacky Sack.
- His balls are ice cold.

01:34:23.731 --> 01:34:27.063
Hi. You're gonna call off
your rigorous investigation.

01:34:27.134 --> 01:34:30.502
You will publicly state
there is no underground group or

01:34:30.605 --> 01:34:32.903
these guys are gonna take your balls.

01:34:33.808 --> 01:34:37.609
<i>They'll send one to the New York Times
and one to the LA Times.</i>

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.442
Look.

01:34:39.514 --> 01:34:42.609
The people you are after
are the people you depend on.

01:34:42.685 --> 01:34:46.246
We cook your meals. We haul your trash.
We connect your calls.

01:34:46.355 --> 01:34:50.086
We drive your ambulances.
We guard you while you sleep.

01:34:54.530 --> 01:34:57.329
Do not fuck with us.

01:35:04.741 --> 01:35:06.868
Ball check!

01:35:21.192 --> 01:35:23.284
Bob, you're this way.

01:35:24.394 --> 01:35:26.727
Let's go.

01:35:26.797 --> 01:35:29.994
<i>I am Jack's inflamed sense of rejection.</i>

01:35:31.102 --> 01:35:33.160
Hey!

01:35:47.685 --> 01:35:48.948
Yeah!

01:36:21.721 --> 01:36:24.519
<i>I felt like putting a bullet in every panda</i>

01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:28.458
<i>that wouldn't screw to save its species.</i>

01:36:30.596 --> 01:36:33.361
<i>I wanted to open the dump valves
on oil tankers</i>

01:36:33.467 --> 01:36:36.334
<i>and smother those French beaches
I'd never see.</i>

01:36:39.605 --> 01:36:42.074
<i>I wanted to breathe smoke.</i>

01:36:59.461 --> 01:37:01.587
Where did you go, psycho boy?

01:37:03.298 --> 01:37:06.233
I felt like destroying something beautiful.

01:37:09.772 --> 01:37:11.830
Get him to a fucking hospital.

01:37:11.906 --> 01:37:13.999
Yeah.

01:37:24.787 --> 01:37:27.847
Don't worry, Mr. Durden.
Airport parking. Long term.

01:37:29.325 --> 01:37:31.453
After you, Mr. Durden.

01:37:32.395 --> 01:37:34.487
After you.

01:37:52.249 --> 01:37:54.844
- Something on your mind, dear?
- No.

01:37:54.919 --> 01:37:58.149
Yeah, why wasn't I told
about Project Mayhem?

01:37:58.255 --> 01:38:01.248
First rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not ask questions.

01:38:01.325 --> 01:38:03.725
Why didn't you include me in the beginning?

01:38:03.828 --> 01:38:09.027
Fight Club was the beginning. Now it's left
the basements and it's Project Mayhem.

01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:13.503
We started Fight Club together. Remember?
It's as much mine as it is yours.

01:38:13.571 --> 01:38:17.837
- Is this about you and me?
- Yeah. Weren't we doing this together?

01:38:17.909 --> 01:38:21.345
This does not belong to us.
We are not special.

01:38:21.445 --> 01:38:23.880
Fuck that. You should have told me.

01:38:24.716 --> 01:38:26.707
Hey, Tyler!

01:38:28.553 --> 01:38:31.045
- Goddamn it, Tyler!
- What do you want?!

01:38:31.123 --> 01:38:33.591
A statement of purpose?
Should I e-mail you?

01:38:33.692 --> 01:38:36.320
- Oh...
- You decide your level of involvement!

01:38:36.395 --> 01:38:39.091
I will! I wanna know certain things first!

01:38:39.164 --> 01:38:41.792
- The first rule of Project Mayhem...
- Shut up!

01:38:43.569 --> 01:38:47.301
- I wanna know what you're thinking.
- Fuck what you know!

01:38:47.373 --> 01:38:50.864
Forget about what you think you know
about life, friendship,

01:38:50.943 --> 01:38:53.003
and especially about you and me.

01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:56.341
What is that supposed to mean?

01:38:59.753 --> 01:39:01.913
What are you doing?

01:39:02.822 --> 01:39:05.552
What do you wish you'd done
before you died?

01:39:05.625 --> 01:39:08.493
- Paint a self-portrait.
- Build a house.

01:39:08.596 --> 01:39:10.962
- And you?
- I don't know. Nothing.

01:39:11.031 --> 01:39:13.430
- Get in the right lane.
- You have to know!

01:39:13.566 --> 01:39:16.593
If you died now,
how would you feel about your life?

01:39:16.704 --> 01:39:20.333
I don't know! Nothing good.
Is that what you want to hear?

01:39:20.407 --> 01:39:22.740
- Come on!
- Not good enough.

01:39:22.811 --> 01:39:25.244
Stop fucking around! Tyler!

01:39:26.513 --> 01:39:28.777
Jesus Christ!

01:39:29.517 --> 01:39:31.610
Goddamn it! Goddamn it! Fuck you!

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:33.779
Fuck Fight Club. Fuck Marla!

01:39:33.855 --> 01:39:36.517
I am sick of all your shit!

01:39:36.625 --> 01:39:38.525
OK, man.

01:39:40.328 --> 01:39:42.853
- Quit screwing around. Steer!
- Look at you!

01:39:42.964 --> 01:39:45.728
- Steer!
- Look at you. You're fucking pathetic!

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:50.932
- Why? Why? What are you talking about?
- Why do you think I blew up your condo?

01:39:51.540 --> 01:39:53.064
What?

01:39:53.175 --> 01:39:57.076
Hitting bottom isn't a weekend retreat.
It's not a goddamned seminar.

01:39:57.178 --> 01:40:00.876
Stop trying to control everything
and just let go!

01:40:02.618 --> 01:40:04.449
Let go!

01:40:04.553 --> 01:40:06.647
All right. Fine.

01:40:07.490 --> 01:40:09.424
Fine.

01:41:07.820 --> 01:41:10.288
<i>I'd never been in a car accident.</i>

01:41:10.355 --> 01:41:13.813
<i>This must have been
what all those people felt like</i>

01:41:13.892 --> 01:41:17.089
<i>before I filed them
as statistics in my reports.</i>

01:41:17.162 --> 01:41:19.256
Goddamn!

01:41:22.769 --> 01:41:25.931
We've just had a near-life experience!

01:41:29.776 --> 01:41:31.767
In the world I see,

01:41:31.878 --> 01:41:35.746
you're stalking elk
through the Grand Canyon forests

01:41:35.849 --> 01:41:38.841
around the ruins of Rockefeller Center.

01:41:40.854 --> 01:41:45.189
You'll wear leather clothes
that will last you the rest of your life.

01:41:45.292 --> 01:41:49.854
You'll climb the thick kudzu vines
that wrap the Sears Tower.

01:41:49.930 --> 01:41:54.492
And when you look down,
you'll see tiny figures pounding corn,

01:41:54.568 --> 01:41:58.129
laying strips of venison
in the empty car-pool lane

01:41:58.205 --> 01:42:00.503
of some abandoned superhighway.

01:42:13.955 --> 01:42:16.185
Feel better, champ.

01:42:33.543 --> 01:42:35.340
<i>And then...</i>

01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:36.969
Tyler?

01:42:37.046 --> 01:42:39.139
<i>..Tyler was gone.</i>

01:42:46.522 --> 01:42:48.548
<i>Was I asleep?</i>

01:42:49.626 --> 01:42:51.650
<i>Had I slept?</i>

01:42:51.794 --> 01:42:54.821
You are not a beautiful, unique snowflake...

01:42:54.932 --> 01:42:57.366
<i>The house had become a living thing.</i>

01:42:57.434 --> 01:43:02.065
<i>Wet inside from so many people
sweating and breathing.</i>

01:43:02.573 --> 01:43:05.167
<i>So many people moving, the house moved.</i>

01:43:08.045 --> 01:43:10.139
<i>Planet Tyler.</i>

01:43:10.215 --> 01:43:12.274
<i>I had to hug the walls.</i>

01:43:12.383 --> 01:43:15.476
<i>Trapped inside
this clockwork of space monkeys.</i>

01:43:15.586 --> 01:43:19.387
You shouldn't be smoking in here!
You know how much ether is here!

01:43:19.457 --> 01:43:21.982
<i>Cooking and working and sleeping in teams.</i>

01:43:24.230 --> 01:43:26.288
Hang on a second.

01:43:45.217 --> 01:43:47.913
It's under control, sir.

01:43:50.389 --> 01:43:52.220
Where's Tyler?

01:43:52.291 --> 01:43:55.284
Sir, the first rule of Project Mayhem
is you do not...

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:57.328
Right... OK.

01:43:59.732 --> 01:44:01.860
<i>I'm all alone.</i>

01:44:02.035 --> 01:44:05.664
<i>My father dumped me. Tyler dumped me.</i>

01:44:05.805 --> 01:44:08.036
<i>I am Jack's broken heart.</i>

01:44:12.245 --> 01:44:16.046
<i>What comes next in Project Mayhem
only Tyler knows.</i>

01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:20.147
<i>The second rule is you do not ask questions.</i>

01:44:22.957 --> 01:44:25.653
Get the fuck away from me!
Get the fuck away!

01:44:26.060 --> 01:44:28.119
Who are all these people?

01:44:33.367 --> 01:44:35.665
The Paper Street Soap Company.

01:44:37.238 --> 01:44:39.298
Can I come in?

01:44:42.443 --> 01:44:44.502
He's not here.

01:44:44.578 --> 01:44:46.843
What?

01:44:47.883 --> 01:44:51.444
Tyler isn't here.

01:44:51.520 --> 01:44:53.579
Tyler went away.

01:44:54.056 --> 01:44:56.115
Tyler's gone.

01:45:13.142 --> 01:45:14.871
Get some help!

01:45:26.022 --> 01:45:30.926
Two gunshot wounds coming through!
Make some fucking room!

01:45:30.995 --> 01:45:33.395
What happened? What happened?

01:45:33.497 --> 01:45:36.364
We were on assignment. We were supposed
to kill two birds with one stone.

01:45:37.634 --> 01:45:39.727
Destroy a piece of corporate art...

01:45:39.803 --> 01:45:42.328
Operation Latte Thunder. Go!

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:46.204
..and trash a franchise coffee bar.

01:45:52.617 --> 01:45:54.983
We had it all worked out, sir.

01:46:03.161 --> 01:46:06.427
- It went smooth until...
- Police! Freeze!

01:46:06.532 --> 01:46:09.261
- What?
- They shot Bob.

01:46:10.769 --> 01:46:13.204
- They shot him in the head.
- Fucking pigs!

01:46:18.577 --> 01:46:20.602
Oh, God!

01:46:20.679 --> 01:46:23.978
- Those motherfuckers!
- You morons.

01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:28.181
You're running around in ski masks
trying to blow things up?

01:46:28.255 --> 01:46:30.950
What did you think was gonna happen?!

01:46:32.691 --> 01:46:37.061
OK, quick! Get rid of the evidence.
We gotta get rid of this body!

01:46:37.164 --> 01:46:40.031
- Bury him.
- What?

01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:42.364
Take him to the garden and bury him.

01:46:42.436 --> 01:46:45.303
- Come on, people, let's go!
- Get the fuck off!

01:46:45.405 --> 01:46:48.636
Get away from him!
What are you talking about?

01:46:48.708 --> 01:46:51.303
This isn't fucking evidence.
This is a person.

01:46:51.412 --> 01:46:54.608
He's my friend
and you're not burying him in the garden!

01:46:54.681 --> 01:46:57.674
He was killed serving Project Mayhem, sir.

01:46:57.785 --> 01:46:59.810
- This is Bob.
- Sir, in...

01:46:59.887 --> 01:47:02.014
In Project Mayhem, we have no names.

01:47:02.090 --> 01:47:04.080
Now, you listen to me.

01:47:04.191 --> 01:47:08.686
This is a man and he has a name,
and it's Robert Paulsen, OK?

01:47:08.796 --> 01:47:10.696
- Robert Paulsen.
- He's a man

01:47:10.798 --> 01:47:13.632
and he's dead now because of us.
Do you understand that?

01:47:14.303 --> 01:47:16.600
I understand.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:22.208
In death, a member of Project Mayhem

01:47:22.277 --> 01:47:24.336
has a name.

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:27.415
<i>His name is Robert Paulsen.</i>

01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:29.943
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:30.719 --> 01:47:33.415
His name... is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:33.489 --> 01:47:37.323
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:37.426 --> 01:47:40.486
Come on, guys. Please. Stop it.

01:47:40.562 --> 01:47:43.157
His name is Robert Paulsen.

01:47:43.266 --> 01:47:46.326
Shut up! This is all over with!

01:47:49.572 --> 01:47:52.097
Get the fuck out of here.

01:48:20.804 --> 01:48:25.265
- Tyler?
- No, this is Detective Stern of the Arson Unit.

01:48:25.343 --> 01:48:26.901
I need to see you...

01:48:31.416 --> 01:48:35.477
<i>I went to all the cities
on Tyler's used ticket stubs, barhopping.</i>

01:48:35.554 --> 01:48:40.322
<i>I didn't know how or why, but I could look
at 50 different bars, and somehow I just knew.</i>

01:48:40.393 --> 01:48:44.954
<i>I'm looking for Tyler Durden.
It's very important that I talk to him.</i>

01:48:45.096 --> 01:48:46.723
I wish I could help you,

01:48:46.798 --> 01:48:49.131
sir.

01:48:54.406 --> 01:48:56.500
<i>Every city I went to,</i>

01:48:57.543 --> 01:48:59.943
<i>as soon as I set foot off the plane</i>

01:49:00.546 --> 01:49:02.811
<i>I knew a Fight Club was close.</i>

01:49:02.916 --> 01:49:04.576
Hey! Hey!

01:49:05.651 --> 01:49:07.243
Taxi!

01:49:07.353 --> 01:49:09.413
Look at my face. I'm a member.

01:49:09.523 --> 01:49:12.048
Now, I just need to know if you've seen Tyler.

01:49:12.159 --> 01:49:15.821
I'm not exposed to bespeak
any such information to you

01:49:15.928 --> 01:49:20.628
nor would I, even if I had
said information at this juncture,... be able.

01:49:21.335 --> 01:49:24.999
- You're a moron.
- I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:49:26.374 --> 01:49:31.402
<i>Tyler had been busy...
setting up franchises all over the country.</i>

01:49:34.182 --> 01:49:38.619
<i>Was I asleep? Had I slept?</i>

01:49:38.686 --> 01:49:40.950
<i>Is Tyler my bad dream, or am I Tyler's?</i>

01:49:42.357 --> 01:49:45.417
- We've just heard the stories.
- What kind of stories?

01:49:45.493 --> 01:49:49.759
- Nobody knows what he looks like.
- He has plastic surgery every three years.

01:49:49.831 --> 01:49:52.857
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

01:49:52.967 --> 01:49:57.029
- Is it true about Fight Club in Miami?
- Is Mr. Durden building an army?

01:49:57.172 --> 01:50:00.163
<i>I was living in a state of perpetual déjà vu.</i>

01:50:00.976 --> 01:50:03.035
<i>Everywhere I went,</i>

01:50:03.178 --> 01:50:05.112
<i>I felt I'd already been there.</i>

01:50:05.214 --> 01:50:08.116
<i>It was like following an invisible man.</i>

01:50:09.219 --> 01:50:11.277
<i>The smell of dried blood,</i>

01:50:11.387 --> 01:50:14.879
<i>dirty, bare footprints circling each other.</i>

01:50:15.725 --> 01:50:18.922
<i>That aroma of old sweat, like fried chicken.</i>

01:50:19.029 --> 01:50:22.589
<i>The feel of a floor still warm
from a fight the night before.</i>

01:50:23.466 --> 01:50:26.401
<i>I was always just one step behind Tyler.</i>

01:50:29.306 --> 01:50:32.434
His name is Robert Paulsen...

01:50:37.047 --> 01:50:39.141
Welcome back, sir.

01:50:40.117 --> 01:50:42.210
How have you been?

01:50:42.286 --> 01:50:44.446
Do you know me?

01:50:44.521 --> 01:50:46.922
Is this a test, sir?

01:50:47.024 --> 01:50:48.889
No. This is not a test.

01:50:48.959 --> 01:50:51.223
You were in here last Thursday.

01:50:51.762 --> 01:50:54.061
Thursday?

01:50:54.165 --> 01:50:58.124
You were standing where you are now,
asking how good security is.

01:50:58.769 --> 01:51:00.863
It's tight as a drum, sir.

01:51:03.542 --> 01:51:05.702
Who do you think I am?

01:51:05.776 --> 01:51:08.337
Are you sure this isn't a test?

01:51:08.447 --> 01:51:10.347
No, this is not a test.

01:51:10.449 --> 01:51:12.508
You're Mr. Durden.

01:51:13.852 --> 01:51:16.514
You're the one who gave me this.

01:51:16.588 --> 01:51:20.786
<i>Please return your seat backs
to their full upright and locked position.</i>

01:51:32.271 --> 01:51:34.330
<i>- Yeah?
- Marla, it's me.</i>

01:51:34.407 --> 01:51:36.376
<i>- Have we ever done it?
- Done what?</i>

01:51:36.477 --> 01:51:37.808
Had sex?

01:51:37.911 --> 01:51:40.071
What kind of stupid question is that?

01:51:40.179 --> 01:51:42.545
Stupid because it's yes
or because it's no?

01:51:42.615 --> 01:51:45.210
<i>- Is this a trick?
- No. I need to know...</i>

01:51:45.319 --> 01:51:49.186
You wanna know if I think
we were just having sex or making love?

01:51:49.288 --> 01:51:52.690
<i>- We did make love?
- Is that what you're calling it?</i>

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:55.593
Just answer the question!
Did we do it or not?!

01:51:55.696 --> 01:51:58.598
You fuck me, then snub me.
You love me, you hate me.

01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:01.566
You're sensitive,
then you turn into an asshole.

01:52:01.635 --> 01:52:04.331
Does that describe our relationship, Tyler?

01:52:04.405 --> 01:52:06.499
<i>We just lost cabin pressure.</i>

01:52:06.574 --> 01:52:08.041
What did you just say?

01:52:08.143 --> 01:52:10.509
- What is wrong with you?
- Say my name!

01:52:10.578 --> 01:52:14.241
Tyler Durden!
You fucking freak! What's going on?

01:52:14.349 --> 01:52:16.408
- I'm coming over!
- I'm not there!

01:52:16.518 --> 01:52:19.316
You broke your promise.

01:52:19.387 --> 01:52:21.356
Jesus, Tyler.

01:52:21.424 --> 01:52:24.859
- You fucking talked to her about me.
- What the fuck is going on?

01:52:24.959 --> 01:52:28.418
I asked you for one thing. One simple thing.

01:52:28.531 --> 01:52:30.829
Why do people think that I'm you?

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.458
Answer me!

01:52:35.838 --> 01:52:37.669
Sit.

01:52:40.476 --> 01:52:43.173
Answer me. Why do people think I'm you?

01:52:43.280 --> 01:52:45.440
I think you know.

01:52:45.581 --> 01:52:48.141
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

01:52:48.250 --> 01:52:50.981
Why would anyone
possibly confuse you with me?

01:52:51.054 --> 01:52:53.852
I... I don't know.

01:52:58.628 --> 01:53:01.495
- You got it.
- No.

01:53:01.598 --> 01:53:03.691
- Do not fuck with us!
- Say it.

01:53:05.069 --> 01:53:07.093
Because...

01:53:08.472 --> 01:53:09.632
Say it!

01:53:11.308 --> 01:53:13.368
Because we're the same person.

01:53:13.444 --> 01:53:15.571
That's right.

01:53:15.646 --> 01:53:17.806
<i>We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap.</i>

01:53:17.881 --> 01:53:21.613
- I don't understand this.
- You wanted a way to change your life.

01:53:21.686 --> 01:53:23.779
You could not do this on your own.

01:53:23.855 --> 01:53:25.914
All the ways you wish you could be,

01:53:26.023 --> 01:53:27.888
that's me.

01:53:27.992 --> 01:53:31.120
I look like you wanna look,
I fuck like you wanna fuck.

01:53:31.229 --> 01:53:33.595
I am smart, capable and, most importantly,

01:53:33.664 --> 01:53:36.429
I'm free in all the ways that you are not.

01:53:36.502 --> 01:53:37.491
Oh, no.

01:53:37.603 --> 01:53:40.503
- Tyler's not here. Tyler went away.
- What?

01:53:40.605 --> 01:53:42.904
This isn't possible. This is crazy.

01:53:43.008 --> 01:53:45.033
People do it every day.

01:53:45.110 --> 01:53:48.672
They talk to themselves.
They see themselves as they'd like to be.

01:53:48.748 --> 01:53:52.012
They don't have the courage you have
to just run with it.

01:53:55.822 --> 01:53:59.155
You still wrestle with it,
so sometimes you're still you.

01:53:59.292 --> 01:54:03.956
- We should do this again sometime.
- At times, you imagine you're watching me.

01:54:04.063 --> 01:54:06.554
If this is your first time, you have to fight.

01:54:06.666 --> 01:54:11.036
Little by little,
you're just letting yourself become

01:54:11.871 --> 01:54:13.771
Tyler Durden.

01:54:13.873 --> 01:54:16.671
You are not your job
or how much money you have!

01:54:16.743 --> 01:54:19.144
- No. You have a house.
- Rented in your name.

01:54:19.246 --> 01:54:22.874
- You have jobs, a life.
- You work nights because you can't sleep.

01:54:22.949 --> 01:54:24.746
Or you stay up and make soap.

01:54:24.851 --> 01:54:29.789
- You're fucking Marla, Tyler.
- Technically, you are. It's all the same to her.

01:54:31.525 --> 01:54:33.551
Oh, my God.

01:54:34.562 --> 01:54:36.655
Now you see our dilemma.

01:54:36.730 --> 01:54:38.994
She knows too much.

01:54:39.099 --> 01:54:44.197
I think we're gonna have to talk about
how this might compromise our goals.

01:54:44.339 --> 01:54:46.465
What... What are you saying?

01:54:47.409 --> 01:54:51.675
This is bullshit. This is bullshit,
I'm not listening to this!

01:54:51.746 --> 01:54:54.408
- You are insane!
- No. You're insane.

01:54:54.517 --> 01:54:57.212
We simply do not have time for this crap.

01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:00.915
<i>It's called a changeover.</i>

01:55:00.989 --> 01:55:03.083
<i>The movie goes on</i>

01:55:03.159 --> 01:55:06.287
<i>and nobody in the audience has any idea.</i>

01:55:19.241 --> 01:55:22.938
- Sir! Are you checking out?
- Yeah. Bill me.

01:55:23.012 --> 01:55:25.447
Can you initial this list of phone calls?

01:55:29.852 --> 01:55:33.914
- When were these made?
- Between 2.00 and 3.30 this morning.

01:55:39.763 --> 01:55:43.859
<i>Have I been going to bed earlier every night?
Have I been sleeping later?</i>

01:55:43.967 --> 01:55:48.837
<i>Have I been Tyler longer and longer?</i>

01:55:51.341 --> 01:55:53.776
Is anybody here?

01:55:56.447 --> 01:55:58.540
<i>Déjà vu all over again.</i>

01:56:00.184 --> 01:56:02.675
With enough soap,
one could blow up anything.

01:56:05.023 --> 01:56:07.082
Oh, my God.

01:56:10.996 --> 01:56:13.361
<i>- 1888.
- Who am I calling?</i>

01:56:13.798 --> 01:56:17.462
<i>1888 Franklin. This is maintenance. Hello?</i>

01:56:18.637 --> 01:56:20.229
<i>Hello?</i>

01:56:20.305 --> 01:56:22.432
1888 Franklin Street?

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:24.601
<i>Yes. Can I help you?</i>

01:56:27.046 --> 01:56:29.640
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

01:56:29.715 --> 01:56:32.241
I need to talk to your supervisor right away.

01:56:32.318 --> 01:56:34.444
<i>- Speaking.
- OK, listen to me.</i>

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:37.684
Something terrible
is about to happen to your building.

01:56:37.791 --> 01:56:39.850
<i>It's under control, sir.</i>

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:43.854
<i>- Excuse me?
- Don't worry about us, sir. We're solid.</i>

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:49.466
<i>2160.</i>

01:56:57.077 --> 01:56:59.603
Marla! Marla! Hey, wait!

01:57:01.282 --> 01:57:04.080
Wait! I gotta talk to you! Marla! Marla!

01:57:04.151 --> 01:57:08.315
Your bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom!
They almost broke my arm!

01:57:08.456 --> 01:57:11.152
They were burning their fingertips with lye.

01:57:11.258 --> 01:57:15.218
This needs a tremendous act of faith
on your part, but hear me out.

01:57:15.297 --> 01:57:19.255
- Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
- A little more faith than that.

01:57:22.504 --> 01:57:25.064
I don't wanna hear
anything you have to say.

01:57:25.140 --> 01:57:27.267
You have every right to be...

01:57:27.876 --> 01:57:29.741
I'll just have a coffee, thanks.

01:57:29.845 --> 01:57:32.780
Sir. Anything you order is free of charge, sir.

01:57:32.881 --> 01:57:34.906
Why is it free of charge?

01:57:34.983 --> 01:57:37.043
- Don't ask.
- Whatever.

01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:42.648
I'll have the clam chowder, fried chicken
and baked potato and a chocolate chiffon pie.

01:57:42.724 --> 01:57:44.784
Clean food, please.

01:57:44.894 --> 01:57:47.920
In that case,
may I advise against the clam chowder.

01:57:47.997 --> 01:57:50.090
No clam chowder. Thank you.

01:57:51.567 --> 01:57:53.797
You got about 30 seconds.

01:57:56.506 --> 01:57:58.998
I know I've been acting very strange, OK?

01:57:59.109 --> 01:58:02.544
- I know it seems there's two sides to me...
- Two sides?

01:58:02.612 --> 01:58:07.676
- You're Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Jackass.
- I know. But I realized something important.

01:58:07.751 --> 01:58:11.812
- What?
- The nature of our relationship wasn't clear

01:58:11.922 --> 01:58:14.288
to me for reasons I won't go into.

01:58:14.358 --> 01:58:16.952
- I know I haven't treated you well.
- Whatever.

01:58:17.027 --> 01:58:19.757
No, no. Fifteen seconds, please!

01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:22.129
Fifteen seconds,
don't open your mouth.

01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:24.292
I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry.

01:58:24.368 --> 01:58:28.703
What I've come to realize
is that I really like you, Marla.

01:58:28.773 --> 01:58:30.900
You do?

01:58:30.975 --> 01:58:32.840
I really do.

01:58:32.944 --> 01:58:37.244
I care about you and I don't want anything
bad to happen to you because of me.

01:58:37.348 --> 01:58:40.112
Marla, your life is in danger.

01:58:40.185 --> 01:58:42.119
What?

01:58:42.187 --> 01:58:45.918
You need to leave town for a while.
Get out of any major city.

01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:48.788
- Just go camping...
- You're an insane person.

01:58:48.860 --> 01:58:52.319
- No. I've involved you in something terrible.
- No. Shut up!

01:58:52.398 --> 01:58:54.958
- You're not safe.
- Shut up!

01:58:56.769 --> 01:59:01.206
- Listen, I tried, Tyler. I really tried.
- I know you did.

01:59:01.273 --> 01:59:04.334
There are things about you I like.
You're smart, funny.

01:59:04.411 --> 01:59:06.379
You're spectacular in bed.

01:59:06.446 --> 01:59:07.878
But

01:59:07.980 --> 01:59:10.039
you're intolerable.

01:59:10.149 --> 01:59:12.641
You have very serious emotional problems.

01:59:12.752 --> 01:59:16.688
Deep-seated problems
for which you should seek professional help.

01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:20.749
- I know, and I'm sorry.
- You're sorry, I'm sorry. Everyone's sorry.

01:59:21.895 --> 01:59:23.988
I can't do this any more.

01:59:24.064 --> 01:59:26.157
I can't.

01:59:26.233 --> 01:59:28.293
And I won't.

01:59:28.402 --> 01:59:30.426
I'm gone.

01:59:30.503 --> 01:59:33.199
You can't leave, Marla! You're not safe!

01:59:36.043 --> 01:59:38.705
- Marla, you don't understand!
- Leave me alone!

01:59:38.813 --> 01:59:41.304
- Marla, I am trying to protect you!
- Let go!

01:59:41.415 --> 01:59:44.407
- I don't ever wanna see you again!
- That's fine...

01:59:44.485 --> 01:59:46.612
Here, wait right here!

01:59:50.492 --> 01:59:53.051
Hold it right there! Shut up!

01:59:53.127 --> 01:59:55.254
Take this money and get on this bus.

01:59:55.329 --> 01:59:57.491
I promise I won't bother you again.

01:59:57.633 --> 01:59:59.066
Shut up!

01:59:59.134 --> 02:00:02.331
Please get on the bus. Please get on the bus.

02:00:03.505 --> 02:00:05.632
Why are you doing this?

02:00:05.707 --> 02:00:09.803
They think you're a threat.
I can't explain it now, just trust me!

02:00:09.878 --> 02:00:14.247
- If I know where you are, you won't be safe.
- I'll keep this, it's asshole tax.

02:00:14.316 --> 02:00:18.720
- Fine. Remember, stay out of major cities.
- Tyler.

02:00:20.256 --> 02:00:23.089
You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

02:00:38.107 --> 02:00:40.770
Hello. I need you to arrest me.

02:00:40.878 --> 02:00:43.642
I am the leader of a terrorist organization

02:00:43.714 --> 02:00:48.674
responsible for numerous acts
of vandalism and assault all over this city.

02:00:48.752 --> 02:00:52.654
In the metropolitan area,
we had probably 200 members.

02:00:52.723 --> 02:00:56.524
Chapters have sprung up
in five or six other major cities already.

02:00:56.695 --> 02:00:59.720
This is a tightly-regimented organization

02:00:59.797 --> 02:01:05.395
with many cells capable of operating
independent of central leadership.

02:01:05.503 --> 02:01:09.371
Go to the house, OK? 1537 Paper Street.

02:01:09.474 --> 02:01:11.374
That's our headquarters.

02:01:11.476 --> 02:01:14.070
In the back, buried in the garden,

02:01:14.145 --> 02:01:17.172
you'll find the body of Robert Paulsen.

02:01:17.283 --> 02:01:20.581
In the basement,
you're gonna find some bathtubs

02:01:20.719 --> 02:01:26.022
that have been used very recently
to make large quantities of nitroglycerin.

02:01:26.125 --> 02:01:28.150
I believe the plan is to blow up

02:01:28.227 --> 02:01:31.321
the headquarters
of these credit card companies

02:01:31.397 --> 02:01:33.490
and the TRW building.

02:01:34.433 --> 02:01:37.800
Why these buildings?
Why credit card companies?

02:01:37.903 --> 02:01:41.498
If you erase the debt record,
then we all go back to zero.

02:01:42.341 --> 02:01:44.400
You'll create total chaos.

02:01:46.013 --> 02:01:49.244
Keep him talking. I need to make a phone
call.

02:01:59.826 --> 02:02:02.057
I really admire what you're doing.

02:02:02.530 --> 02:02:04.588
What?

02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:06.756
You're a brave man to order this.

02:02:06.833 --> 02:02:08.597
You're a genius, sir.

02:02:08.736 --> 02:02:13.435
You said if anyone ever interferes
with Project Mayhem, even you,

02:02:13.541 --> 02:02:15.873
we gotta get his balls.

02:02:17.278 --> 02:02:20.441
- Don't fight.
- It's a powerful gesture, Mr. Durden.

02:02:20.548 --> 02:02:23.575
- It will set an example.
- You're making a big mistake!

02:02:23.652 --> 02:02:26.484
- You said you'd say that.
- I'm not Tyler Durden!

02:02:26.587 --> 02:02:30.456
- You told us you'd say that too.
- All right. I am Tyler Durden.

02:02:30.559 --> 02:02:33.255
Listen to me. I'm giving you a direct order.

02:02:33.362 --> 02:02:37.492
- We're aborting this mission now.
- You said you would definitely say that.

02:02:43.639 --> 02:02:47.201
Are you fucking out of your minds?
You're police officers!

02:02:48.043 --> 02:02:50.102
Is somebody timing this?

02:02:50.279 --> 02:02:53.249
Keep your mouth shut.

02:02:53.316 --> 02:02:55.409
Shit!

02:02:58.054 --> 02:03:00.852
Some of this information checks out.

02:03:00.924 --> 02:03:04.223
- Let's go to that house on Paper Street.
- Be right there.

02:03:04.928 --> 02:03:06.692
Hey, wait!

02:03:07.398 --> 02:03:09.922
- I got him.
- Sir, we have to do this.

02:03:10.033 --> 02:03:12.501
- Stop fighting!
- Where's the rubber band?

02:03:12.602 --> 02:03:15.094
Get away from me! Drop that fucking knife!

02:03:18.642 --> 02:03:22.078
Back up. Face down on the floor right now!

02:03:23.314 --> 02:03:25.339
Get down on the floor!

02:03:30.122 --> 02:03:33.022
The first person
that comes out of this door

02:03:33.090 --> 02:03:35.058
gets a lead salad! Understand?

02:03:59.385 --> 02:04:01.979
Get away! Stay away!

02:04:14.935 --> 02:04:16.993
<i>I ran.</i>

02:04:17.537 --> 02:04:21.702
<i>I ran until my muscles burned
and my veins pumped battery acid.</i>

02:04:24.344 --> 02:04:26.402
<i>Then I ran some more.</i>

02:05:07.122 --> 02:05:09.420
What the fuck are you doing?

02:05:09.525 --> 02:05:12.460
Running around in your underpants!
You look crazy!

02:05:12.561 --> 02:05:15.655
No. I'm onto you.
I know what's going on here.

02:05:15.764 --> 02:05:20.668
Come on, then. I got us a great place
to watch from. It'll be like pay-per-view.

02:06:08.653 --> 02:06:11.316
- Oh, Christ.
- Now what are you doing?

02:06:11.423 --> 02:06:14.790
- I'm stopping this.
- Why?

02:06:14.860 --> 02:06:18.261
- The greatest thing you've ever done.
- I can't let this happen.

02:06:18.330 --> 02:06:21.595
There are 10 other bombs
in 10 other buildings.

02:06:21.667 --> 02:06:24.033
Since when is Project Mayhem
about murder?

02:06:24.102 --> 02:06:26.094
The buildings are empty.

02:06:26.205 --> 02:06:29.037
We're not killing anyone.
We're setting 'em free!

02:06:29.107 --> 02:06:31.871
Bob is dead. They shot him in the head.

02:06:32.010 --> 02:06:35.344
You wanna make an omelette,
you gotta break some eggs.

02:06:35.448 --> 02:06:39.042
No. I'm not listening to you.
You're not even there.

02:06:45.091 --> 02:06:49.460
I wouldn't do that.
Not unless you knew which wires were what.

02:06:49.529 --> 02:06:51.258
If you know, I know.

02:06:56.870 --> 02:07:01.238
<i>Or maybe I knew you'd know, so I spent
all day thinking about the wrong ones.</i>

02:07:09.751 --> 02:07:10.842
You think?

02:07:12.853 --> 02:07:14.946
Oh, heavens, no. Not the green one.

02:07:15.789 --> 02:07:18.782
Pull any one but the green one.

02:07:23.530 --> 02:07:26.159
I asked you not to do that!

02:07:28.002 --> 02:07:29.560
Fuck!

02:07:30.505 --> 02:07:32.598
Tyler, get away from the van.

02:07:34.809 --> 02:07:38.210
Tyler, I'm not kidding!
Get away from the van!

02:07:38.313 --> 02:07:39.679
Goddamn it!

02:07:46.021 --> 02:07:47.386
OK.

02:07:47.490 --> 02:07:50.823
You are now firing a gun
at your imaginary friend

02:07:50.926 --> 02:07:53.521
near 400 gallons of nitroglycerin!

02:07:55.731 --> 02:07:57.494
Cool it, Tyler!

02:08:10.714 --> 02:08:12.773
Come on!

02:08:12.849 --> 02:08:14.908
Don't go!

02:08:52.491 --> 02:08:53.685
What?!

02:09:39.173 --> 02:09:39.867
Three minutes.

02:09:40.808 --> 02:09:43.106
This is it.

02:09:43.210 --> 02:09:45.235
The beginning.

02:09:45.312 --> 02:09:47.280
Ground zero.

02:09:47.348 --> 02:09:49.646
<i>I think this is about where we came in.</i>

02:09:49.717 --> 02:09:52.209
Do you have a speech for the occasion?

02:09:52.287 --> 02:09:55.312
I'm sorry?

02:09:55.422 --> 02:09:57.481
I still can't think of anything.

02:09:59.528 --> 02:10:01.621
Flashback humor.

02:10:06.701 --> 02:10:08.726
It's getting exciting now.

02:10:10.305 --> 02:10:12.102
Two and a half.

02:10:12.173 --> 02:10:14.734
Think of everything we've accomplished.

02:10:14.844 --> 02:10:19.644
Out these windows, we will view
the collapse of financial history.

02:10:19.714 --> 02:10:23.446
One step closer to economic equilibrium.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.399
Why is she here?

02:10:39.502 --> 02:10:41.402
Tying up loose ends.

02:10:41.504 --> 02:10:44.565
Put me down, you baldheaded fuck!

02:10:44.675 --> 02:10:47.769
- I beg you, please don't do this.
- I'm not doing this.

02:10:47.878 --> 02:10:51.336
<i>- We are doing this. This is what we want.
- No.</i>

02:10:51.415 --> 02:10:56.148
- I don't want this.
- Right. Except you is meaningless now.

02:10:56.219 --> 02:11:00.213
- We have to forget about you.
- You're a voice in my head.

02:11:00.325 --> 02:11:02.383
You're a voice in mine!

02:11:02.492 --> 02:11:05.326
- Why can't I get rid of you?
- You need me.

02:11:05.396 --> 02:11:07.489
No. I don't. I really don't any more.

02:11:07.565 --> 02:11:11.832
You created me. I didn't create some
loser alter ego to make me feel better.

02:11:11.937 --> 02:11:15.895
- Take some responsibility.
- I do. I am responsible for all of it

02:11:16.007 --> 02:11:17.736
and I accept that.

02:11:17.809 --> 02:11:21.837
So, please, I'm begging you,
please call this off.

02:11:23.848 --> 02:11:26.043
Have I ever let us down?

02:11:27.519 --> 02:11:29.817
How far have you come because of me?!

02:11:35.728 --> 02:11:37.787
I will bring us through this.

02:11:37.863 --> 02:11:41.664
As always, I will carry you
kicking and screaming

02:11:41.768 --> 02:11:44.202
and in the end you will thank me.

02:11:44.671 --> 02:11:47.195
Tyler. Tyler.

02:11:47.272 --> 02:11:50.800
I'm grateful to you.
For everything that you've done for me.

02:11:50.877 --> 02:11:53.573
But this is too much. I don't want this.

02:11:53.647 --> 02:11:58.949
What do you want? Your shitjob back?
Fucking condo world, watching sitcoms?

02:11:59.019 --> 02:12:01.078
Fuck you! I won't do it.

02:12:01.955 --> 02:12:05.790
- This can't be happening.
- It's already done, so shut up!

02:12:05.860 --> 02:12:07.486
60 seconds till CRI.

02:12:08.028 --> 02:12:10.087
No.

02:12:11.999 --> 02:12:14.797
I can figure this out. This isn't even real.

02:12:14.869 --> 02:12:18.566
You're not real, that gun...
That gun isn't even in your hand.

02:12:20.041 --> 02:12:22.100
The gun's in my hand.

02:12:27.115 --> 02:12:29.605
Good for you. It doesn't change a thing.

02:12:38.493 --> 02:12:41.121
Why do you wanna put a gun to your head?

02:12:41.263 --> 02:12:43.322
Not my head, Tyler.

02:12:43.899 --> 02:12:45.924
Our head.

02:12:47.470 --> 02:12:49.529
Interesting.

02:12:52.541 --> 02:12:55.204
Where are you going with this, Ikea boy?

02:13:01.683 --> 02:13:04.676
Hey. It's you and me.

02:13:07.423 --> 02:13:09.483
Friends?

02:13:10.327 --> 02:13:12.420
Tyler,

02:13:15.832 --> 02:13:18.165
I want you to really listen to me.

02:13:18.302 --> 02:13:20.736
OK.

02:13:20.838 --> 02:13:22.897
My eyes are open.

02:13:41.659 --> 02:13:43.684
What's that smell?

02:14:03.315 --> 02:14:06.307
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, no. What's going on?

02:14:06.952 --> 02:14:08.544
Mr. Durden!

02:14:09.622 --> 02:14:11.487
Oh, my God!

02:14:16.830 --> 02:14:20.026
Are you... Are you all right, sir?

02:14:20.132 --> 02:14:24.092
- Oh, yeah, I'm OK.
- You look terrible, sir. What happened?

02:14:24.171 --> 02:14:28.164
- Nothing, it's no problem.
- No, no, no, sir. He's not kidding.

02:14:28.241 --> 02:14:31.005
- You look awful. You need assistance.
- I'm fine.

02:14:31.144 --> 02:14:34.739
Look, I'm fine... Everything's fine.

02:14:37.017 --> 02:14:39.248
Stop it!

02:14:39.387 --> 02:14:42.514
- Let her go.
- Christ Almighty!

02:14:42.589 --> 02:14:44.386
You!

02:14:44.457 --> 02:14:46.551
Hi, Marla.

02:14:47.028 --> 02:14:51.862
- Leave her with me. Meet me downstairs.
- Are you sure?

02:14:51.966 --> 02:14:54.025
Yes, I'm sure.

02:14:55.136 --> 02:14:59.232
You fucker! What kind of sick
fucking game are you playing at?!

02:14:59.374 --> 02:15:02.036
Putting me on a... Oh, my God, your face!

02:15:02.144 --> 02:15:03.633
Yeah, I know.

02:15:08.417 --> 02:15:10.282
What happened?

02:15:10.419 --> 02:15:12.546
- Don't ask.
- You're shot.

02:15:12.621 --> 02:15:14.680
- Yes, I'm shot.
- Oh, my God.

02:15:15.624 --> 02:15:18.650
- I can't believe he's standing.
- One tough motherfucker.

02:15:22.465 --> 02:15:24.296
Who did this?

02:15:24.433 --> 02:15:26.901
I did, actually.

02:15:27.002 --> 02:15:29.062
Find some gauze.

02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:32.465
You shot yourself?

02:15:32.575 --> 02:15:35.203
Yes, but it's OK. Marla, look at me.

02:15:35.278 --> 02:15:37.576
I'm really OK.

02:15:37.647 --> 02:15:41.606
Trust me. Everything's gonna be fine.

02:15:54.431 --> 02:15:58.299
You met me at a very strange time in my life.
